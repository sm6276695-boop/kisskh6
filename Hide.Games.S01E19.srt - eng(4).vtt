I'll trust you one more time.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.680
(Insider cop)
It was this number.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.160
If you make the right choice,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.840
everything will come to light.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.800

there's no turning back.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.040
All these checks
are ruining my business.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.560
I live in the last room; I lost my key.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.920
You lost the key?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.640
Why are you still alive?

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.420
(Reward wanted notice)

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.440
I'll grab my stuff and go.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.520
Hurry up; we're almost there.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.520
Han Xu, wait for me.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.920
As you requested, you're moved

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.320
(Grooming)
to the Narcotics Unit.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.800
I, Han Xu, swear

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.280
to wipe out all drugs.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.160
How does it feel to be left behind?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.120
I'll tell you the whole truth.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.200
It's just photoshopping.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.100
She was not your wife.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.820
You actually think
Xiao Ran was your wife?

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.120
Did the amnesia drive you crazy?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.560
- You don't even deserve her.
- Xu.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.340
Han Xu.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.300
Who are you?

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.060
I'm you.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.060
Go back.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.600
The lighthouse in your hometown

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.100
is where it all began.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.060
The lighthouse?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.820
You're sure it's Han Xu?

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.500
It's definitely him.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.740
Get over here now.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.540
Fortune Hotel.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.700
I'm on my way.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.340
Make sure you keep him there.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.420
And my bonus?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.900
Dispatch just sent an update.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.260
They found Han Xu.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.020
You two go with Chief Ma now.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.180
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.740
Nice burn.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.780
You'd better burn it all

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.180
and pretend nothing ever happened

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.460
to keep your head buried

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.580
and stay the coward you are.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.620
Shut up.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.300
You're just in my head.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.480
Just a shadow, nothing more.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.020
You're not real.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.340
You think
I'll believe you exist like this?

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.660
But I'm already here.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.180
Hello?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.300
Why aren't you here yet?

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.660
Keep him there; we're almost there.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.180
Check out.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.540
Stay one more night.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.420
It's our anniversary today.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.620
It's free.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.940
You should kill her.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.960
Deduct it from the room fee.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.060
Chief Han.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.780
Does stealing your own car

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.500
count as a crime?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.320
Don't you feel something's missing?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.380
Even the photos are fake.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.000
Then what's actually real?

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.620
Where are you going?

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.720
I'm going to get rid of you.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.040
Got anything to drink?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.940
I'm glad

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.060
that you came to me.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.840
Why's the water fountain not dripping?

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.160
Yeah.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.100
It's been fixed lately.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.700
You've been using these to hypnotize me.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.180
Isn't that so?

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.260
Every time I hypnotize you,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.780
I've always told you beforehand.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.960
I'm not talking
about just those two times.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.780
I mean your whole plan.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.200
These days, I've been through a lot.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.000
And I've figured it all out.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.180
The drops from the water fountain,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.600
the neon light at my place,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.540
and the bulb in the interrogation room

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.540
are all tools

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.260
you used to hypnotize me, right?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.820
When I lost my memory,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.180
you were putting on an act around me.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.060
I kept trying to make sense of it,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.860
but there are still so many things

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.800
I just can't figure out.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.860
From the very start,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.180
you hypnotized me.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.980
I've been trapped in a huge trance.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.220
Right?

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.740
Yes.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.300
It's called lucid hypnosis.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.820
The goal

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.620
was to help you get your memory back.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.500
But the moment you stopped trusting me,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.940
the plan had already failed.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.600
Everything you went through after that

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.900
wasn't part of the plan.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.180
Come on.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.680
What exactly is in my memory?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.040
Why did you have such a huge plan?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.740
Even Wang Mingcheng is trying to use me.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.380
They're after the drug refined formula.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.400
But all I want is for you to come back.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.260
How so?

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.540
I can't tell you.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.340
Because your memory hasn't returned.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.780
You've been through too much too fast.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.140
Your brain
is locking away those memories

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.060
deep in your mind.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.660
If I told you

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.500
everything I know,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.820
your mind could break from it.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.460
It might even split apart.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.020
The damage would be beyond repair.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.480
So you have

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.860
to remember everything on your own.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.700
How do you know

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.020
I haven't gotten my memory back?

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.860
Alright.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.260
Look at me.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.220
I just know it.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.580
Look at you.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.180
You made that young girl cry.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.780
What's it to you?

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.140
What's wrong?

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.420
What did you see?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.060
Another me.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.260
Right beside you.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.780
Take a break first.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.900
Take a rest.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.050
Rest first.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.380
Don't think about anything, okay?

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.940
See?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.340
I told you to be a coward.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.100
Shut up.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.380
Technically speaking,

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.740
you lied to me.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.800
I shouldn't have come here.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.180
But I still did.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.820
Do you know why?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.780
Memories can fool you.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.000
But feelings never lie.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.260
My feelings tell me

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.380
you can help me.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.100
You're someone I can count on.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.980
Come on.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.780
What could she possibly do?

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.020
Shut up.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.300
Keep your voice down.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.420
She's right here.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.380
Don't scare her off.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.540
Can you stop?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.140
I have an idea.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.220
What idea?
