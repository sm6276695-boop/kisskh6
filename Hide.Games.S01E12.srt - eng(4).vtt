(Wu)
Master, where are you?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.480
I found a clue in 405.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.480
Eight tonight at the usual place.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.280
This poor soul

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.640
was supposed
to meet you tonight at eight.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.360
But he can't wait any longer.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.480
Only you can save him now.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.920
Han Xu.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.520
Over here.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.920
Don't move.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.160
Master.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.320
Think.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.520
Master.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.400
Tell me who he is.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.760
Master.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.720
Who is he?

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.960
- Master.
- Who is he?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.000
Tell me who he is.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.840
Who is he?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.680
Tell me.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.560
Who is he?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.720
Think. Who is he?

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.820
Tell me who he is.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.720
Tell me.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.170
Tell me who he is.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.640
Seems you really like this pendant.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.960
My dad gave it to me.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.040
I've always treated it as my amulet.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.920
Now, I want you to have it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
When we meet again,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.120
you can give it back to me.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.880
Nuo, go back to your room.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.160
Mom, I want to let...

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.000
Be good.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.840
Alright.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.920
Sorry about that.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.840
She really misses her dad.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.960
Where is this place?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.080
How did I end up here?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000
This is my old house.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.360
Don't worry; it's safe here.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.320
What happened to you?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.200
Did you remember anything?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.800
Can I trust you?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.720
Of course.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.120
You have to trust me.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.020
After all you've been through...

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.120
Nothing came back to you?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.560
Nothing at all.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.000
I just felt

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
a bit disappointed

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.880
and sad.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.400
Nothing else.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.720
I hope everything goes well

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.280
and Chen can make it.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.240
If you want to succeed,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.880
don't rush the plan too much.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.400
Now, it's full of holes.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.080
Don't think I don't know

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.880
the things you did in secret.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.360
The one who is ruining the plan

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.280
is you.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.000
If you'd like,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.480
I can try hypnosis again.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.480
Let's give it a shot.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.840
Sure.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.600
Mom.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.260
I'll wash my face and get ready.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.520
Director.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.880
You said it.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.440
This is my case,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.160
and I'll take charge of everything.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.200
Right here.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.660
Send a few more people downstairs.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.680
Let's just wait and see.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.320
He doesn't trust me anymore.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.760
Got it.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320
Chief Han.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.080
This call came later than I expected.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.720
You seem to know me pretty well.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.000
Of course, better than you think.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.760
How else would I prepare
such a thoughtful gift?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.600
I told you

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.600
I'd get a return gift for you.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.360
I'm going to kill you.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.160
Want to kill me?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.600
Figure out who I am first.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.720
I will find out.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.050
How many days have we been here?

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.000
What are we waiting for?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.480
Did we mess something up at work?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.180
Is that why they sent us here?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.360
- Look at that.
- Stop whining.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.480
Let's finish this and go.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.600
We can grab drinks after.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.640
Let's leave now.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.490
No way.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.330
Let's go.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.400
Hey man, did this phone get wet?

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.500
Luckily, it's this model.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.920
Or I wouldn't have taken it.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.960
Name your price.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.860
Give me however much you want.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.500
There's an audio recording inside.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.620
Save it to this USB drive.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.700
Take the fee from that.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600
Got it.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.420
(Import Sound)

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.140
Of course,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.200
better than you think.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.990
How else would I prepare

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.630
such a thoughtful gift?

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.060
(Sound Synthesis)

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.340
Want to kill me?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.900
Chief Han.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.180
Figure out who I am first.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.580
Figure out who I am first.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.140
Figure out who I am first.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.000
(Analysis Successful)
Want to kill me?

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.940
Figure out who I am first.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.900
Want a combat?

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.780
Wait until you're healed.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.460
No problem, that's what friends do.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.340
Please.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.540
Take care of my sister for me.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.570
Can you do that?

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.620
If you hadn't come to me,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.980
you'd never spot the trick.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.100
She's really naive.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.040
I'm afraid she'll get scammed.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.020
Someone made me say that.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.260
Hey, I want to check out.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.420
Single room.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.700
ID, please.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.940
I forgot to bring it.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.660
100 for an 85-room.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.890
Second floor.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.200
The one at the end of the hall.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.420
(Feels like Home)

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:34.620
(Xiao Ran, An Shaocong, Wang Jian,
Chen Yasin, Zhang Ahua, Chief Ma)

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.980
It was from a temporary number.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.980
He said

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.500
his name was Han Xu.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.500
(Was it me? The killer?)

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.900
I just saw the whole crime happen.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.980
Like I was right there in it.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.180
(Chen Yasin)

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.060
From what I see,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.740
you don't have a split personality.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.380
(Watch out)

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.820
(Director Zhou)
If you choose wrong,

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.540
there's no turning back.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.140
(Wang Jian, police, plot)
I won't let you get away again.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.980
(Police, plot)

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.020
I'll look into everything.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.500
(Wu, trusted friend)
Only we know this dialect.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.440
(An Shaocong)
Reliable.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.540
(Chen Yasin)
Don't give up.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.480
(Reliable, Zhang Ahua)

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.820
(Xiao Ran)

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.080
(Memories)

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.020
(Was it me? The killer?)

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.120
(Chief Ma, Director Zhou)

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.980
(Director Zhou)

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.240
(Wu)

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.440
(Odd)

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:12.640
(Ma)

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:12.880
(Zhou)

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.180
(Ahua)

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.340
(An)

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:13.540
(Ran)

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:13.800
(Chen)

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.060
(Wang)

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.700
(Me)

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.740
(Memories coming back)

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.180
(The student could be fake)

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.300
How did your mom teach you?

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.500
I asked for cigarettes,
yet you brought water.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.440
How did you mix up water and cigarettes?

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.860
You always speak dialect.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.980
I can't understand you.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.660
No dialect next time.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.140
Get me a glass of water.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.940
Water.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.540
It's been ages since I spoke dialect.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.200
I can barely catch the words.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.660
(Wu)

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.820
(Wu)

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.180
(Wu)

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.180
Officer 67234 reporting in.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.500
From now on, you'll be my master.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.660
There's a bit of history between us.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.820
So, please look out for me.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.700
Who are you?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.300
I don't think I've seen you before.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.580
You don't know?

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.900
I'm your junior.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.100
In the whole South District,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.300
only we share a hometown.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.620
Back home, you're a big deal.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.460
Did you know that?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.420
Master,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.220
have some water.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.300
Master,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.940
how about a cigarette?

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
It's been ages since I heard our accent.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.780
You speak it really well.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.100
Of course.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.220
I grew up there for over 20 years.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.060
It's in my bones.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.360
No way I got this wrong.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.500
(Wu)

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.780
It's been ages since I spoke dialect.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.520
I can barely catch the words.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.380
Officer 67234 reporting in.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.180
From now on, you'll be my master.
