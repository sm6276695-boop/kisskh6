00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.000
You're way too anxious.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.220
This can't go on.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.420
What a coincidence.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.980
I drink this brand too.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.140
It was your favorite back in college.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.420
Sometimes I grab a sip as well.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.460
Mind if I smoke?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.180
I didn't smoke in college, remember?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.060
The last guest left it.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.780
Looks like you share a taste.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.060
Guess you're lucky tonight.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.620
But better not to do it.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.540
For your health.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.740
For me right now,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.100
the word "luck"

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.740
feels out of reach.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.540
You know you can talk to me.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.380
Don't forget,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.580
I'm a psychiatrist.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.420
Alright then.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.300
There's no point hiding it.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.220
I thought I just had

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.580
a split personality

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.260
and became a murderer.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.980
But then you told me,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.520
I never had an episode.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.620
Wu said to me,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.820
someone set me up on purpose.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.880
So I went to the station for evidence.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.080
The video shows that the murderer is me.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.180
But it was shot two months ago.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.700
Right when I lost my memory,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.580
as you said.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.670
This whole thing

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.280
becomes more complicated, right?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.580
I still can't prove myself innocent.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.160
The Han Xu I remembered

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.180
could never be the murderer.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.530
What was Han Xu like

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.500
in your memory?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.940
He was righteous,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.980
brave,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.100
and wise.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.540
Most importantly,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.300
he never gave up easily.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.740
So you shouldn't give up.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220
Then how can I get my memory back?

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.700
Regaining memory is tough.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.700
Sometimes it happens in a flash.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.740
Sometimes it takes three to five years.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.940
Or it may never happen.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.220
But based on your situation,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.420
I see two approaches.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.060
First, I tried hypnosis on you once.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.740
You started to remember some things.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.980
Second, according to you,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.340
before you got the evidence,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.940
the parking lot brought back memories.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.100
Just fragments, but still memories.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.540
So here's what I suggest:

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.940
Try to find something else,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.140
anything that might really trigger you.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.820
Then we can use hypnosis to treat you.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.180
Alright.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.260
I'll fetch something. Wait here.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.580
Looking for these?

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.700
Are you serious?

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.060
You think I'm the culprit,
but didn't arrest me.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.560
Instead, you wait for me here.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.060
The stuff's right there,
but you don't take it.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.500
Why?

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.100
Because we are friends.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.820
You didn't get rid of this stuff,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.500
so I was right about you.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.260
You're still the guy I know.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.420
But I was wrong about you.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.100
You think you're clever,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.660
using a video from two months ago

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.380
to pin a murder on me from two days ago.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.580
What are you talking about?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.660
I had someone check it out.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.220
The underlying timecode on this video

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.180
has been tampered with.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.660
It's shot two months ago.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.620
No way.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.020
It's decrypted yesterday.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.940
That's why we were after you.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.540
Han Xu, you're stealing evidence.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.780
That's a crime.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.340
Wang.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.940
After so many years,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.460
you haven't improved much.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.100
But your acting's gotten better.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.070
Alright then.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.460
Take me to whoever checked this.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.780
- I'll ask.
- To silence them?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.100
Han Xu, are you insane?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.200
I lost my memory, not mind.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.140
Are they trustworthy?

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.580
Why can't I see the autopsy report?

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.540
Is what they said legit?

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.420
You faked the report.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.320
You framed me, smeared Mr. An and Ran.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.970
You're crazy!

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.820
What's your motive?

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.900
Fine.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.780
Let me make it clear.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.140
I didn't fake any autopsy report.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.220
I hid it for confidentiality, that's all.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.540
And I didn't collude
with the forensic doctor.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.060
Fine.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.420
Act all you want.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.780
So what now?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.620
Let me guess.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.980
What you just said

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.420
is what Wu told you, right?

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.660
I've had doubts about him for ages.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.580
The reason I came today

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.420
is to ask you to turn yourself in.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.980
I can't wait any longer.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.260
You need to come with me.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.180
My people are all outside.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:08.540
I hope you,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.420
keep some dignity as police.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.820
Alright.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.620
Let me ask you one thing.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.620
Just answer me.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.060
Forget about detective work,

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.380
and forget our friendship.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.020
What do you think

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.100
the relationship

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.700
between Mr. An and Xiao Ran?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.820
I honestly have no idea.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:05.940
But I trust the evidence.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.020
Get in.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.820
Don't go.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.540
Don't!

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.820
Han Xu, please, don't go.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.180
Han Xu!

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.100
Han Xu!

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.620
Han Xu!

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.640
Thought you weren't coming.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.740
Don't wait for me.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.940
I can't make it.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:01.460
Did something happen?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.620
Wang Jian caught me.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.140
But I escaped.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.230
I'm worried I will drag you

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.820
into this.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:07.860
Wang Jian?

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.860
That's impossible.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.220
Hard to explain over the phone.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.420
Anyway, thank you.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.300
I'll figure out the truth.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.940
Who helped you?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.260
Was it Wu, that guy?

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.220
From what I see now,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.140
something's off with Wu too.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.920
Don't know who to trust.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.260
Send me your address.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.100
I'll go meet you.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.440
To stir things up?

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.300
Han Xu,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.900
listen to me carefully,

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.860
to me,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.860
you'll always be

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.940
the righteous, brave, and wise police.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.860
If you ever need anything, just tell me.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.940
Anytime, anywhere.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.300
Thanks.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.500
Hey Ahua,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.100
remember the mystery box I gave you?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.020
What did you get?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.900
I got a standard edition.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.020
What about you?

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.380
Hold on, I'm still opening mine.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.220
It's the Secret Queen of Hearts!

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.140
Wow, that's so lucky!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.660
Officer Han,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.300
you don't need to.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.380
No charge for that video.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.660
I need you to tell me the truth.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.140
Hey, don't joke around.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.580
I haven't done anything to upset you.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.060
Tell me,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.340
when was this video recorded?

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.300
I don't know.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.580
I swear! I honestly have no idea.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.700
I lied to you.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.740
But the video's timecode

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.700
has been masked.
