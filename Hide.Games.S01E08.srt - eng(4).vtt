00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.280
Chief Han, impressive moves.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.640
How's Chen doing?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.760
Chief Ma, you're even better.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.430
One hid inside the house,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.760
and another in the car.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.080
Better safe than sorry, you know.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.640
Especially since I'm meeting you.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.950
Now tell me,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.520
who do you work for?

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.160
Of course, I'm with the police station.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.160
If the station wanted to catch me,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.960
they'll send more men.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.200
Han,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.920
being too smart
isn't always a good thing.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.080
South District, to bail someone out.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.040
I'm the real victim,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.490
yet you locked me up

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.630
for more than 24 hours.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.300
- This is
- When out, I'll file

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.690
- statement letter.
- a complaint.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.440
Dr. Chen,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.520
please be patient.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.580
My daughter's at home.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.600
If anything happens to her,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.720
I'll make sure you all pay for it.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.240
Don't worry,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.960
Nuo is perfectly safe.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.320
This isn't the way to my house.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.840
You need to verify something
at the station.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.120
Like I said,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.400
I'm the victim here.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.360
I got kidnapped.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.440
My kid's still at home.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
Nuo is at the station.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.320
You used my kid to pressure me.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.280
Han Xu was the one who took you.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.920
So we've been watching Nuo for you.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.160
Mom, where did you go?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.880
Nuo's been waiting for you so long.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.440
Good girl,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.800
is everything okay?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.640
Yes.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.240
This lady played with me all night.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.840
I already ate like you asked.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.880
That's good to hear.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.200
Play with her a bit more.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.320
Mom just needs a sec.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.640
Then I'll take you home, okay?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.560
Okay, Mom.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.400
Close the door.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.300
Cut to the chase.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.440
Where's Han Xu?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.000
Han,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.360
don't blame me.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.200
I'm just following orders.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.840
Why waste time talking to him?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.440
Let's just do it.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.680
It's done.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.340
Really?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.500
My years spent on you are worth it.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.140
Where is it? Give it to me.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.860
But I have two conditions.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.300
Go ahead.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.820
Even ten conditions, I'd agree.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.500
First, I want out of the Organization.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.900
Second, I want to leave with Xiao Ran.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.100
You really do care about her.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.650
Want to marry her, huh?

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.500
Yeah, I do.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.580
I can't stand who I am anymore.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.860
I'll quit.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.060
No way.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.900
Why not?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.620
We had a deal.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.820
I'm planning to take care of Xiao Ran.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.580
She might be an informant for the police.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.480
Her being alive is the biggest threat

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.660
to us both.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.500
That's why I'm taking her.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.740
Once we're gone, you won't be at risk.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.580
Only the dead can't threaten anyone.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.660
If you lay a finger on her,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.220
I swear you'll never get what you want.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.500
Alright, fine.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.380
My son's all grown up now.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.580
Doesn't listen to me anymore, huh?

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.500
Well,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.900
you can stay in this room

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.060
and reflect.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.140
Don't even try to use Xiao Ran's fate

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.780
to threaten me.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.340
Hello, sir.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.660
A gentleman just mentioned,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.820
you have a special situation,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.660
so you can't go out.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.500
We'll deliver your meal on time.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.660
Have a great day.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.380
Remember this.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.660
The clue is in 405.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.860
Where's Han Xu?

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.740
Isn't that your job to find out?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.580
Chen Yasin,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.300
it's not that we doubt you.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.100
Don't you think it's all too convenient?

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.780
And I don't believe you escaped

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.180
someone as careful as Han Xu.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.020
What do you mean?

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.990
You think I'm working with him?

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.060
Where's your proof?

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.180
What's my motive?

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.700
That's enough.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.260
Chen Yasin,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.140
we both know what's going on.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.940
So maybe talk to me as someone else.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.700
Director Zhou,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.100
what role are you taking on,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.260
coming all the way to see me?

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.780
Of course, I'm here as a friend.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.140
Xiao Han,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.140
it was my idea for Ma and Chen.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.380
Let me apologize first.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.380
We really acted a bit rashly.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.340
You managed to leave
Wang Jian and Wu behind

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.340
to get all the way here.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.700
That's no small feat.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.100
No wonder everyone speaks highly of you.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.580
Even with your memory loss,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.100
your instincts are still spot on,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.420
always catching the real issue right away.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.620
So, I'll get straight to the point.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.540
Things at the police station are tense.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.780
I'm in a dilemma.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.860
There's no one I can trust.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.860
Everyone has their own agenda.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.700
I'm really sorry.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.160
I don't have the answer you want.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.660
You might not have answers yet,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.700
but that doesn't mean

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.860
the answer isn't somewhere in your mind.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.300
Look at this abandoned building.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.060
Have you ever wondered,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.740
how did you lose your memory?

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.900
You're saying,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.740
I fell from here?

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.620
Surviving great hardship

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.060
brings good fortune.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.940
I'm the one who made you fall again.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.180
Did anything come back to you?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.120
You should call me dad.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.500
Calling me by name?

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.860
I really hate who I am now.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.780
I'll quit.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.140
Director Zhou,

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.660
are you that sure

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.780
I'm clean too?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.340
Listen to yourself.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.180
In this police department,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.300
if you're not clean,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.260
then no one here is.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.500
Sorry.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.020
I didn't remember anything.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.060
I was just too scared.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.540
Got it.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.780
I did this

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.260
so you'd at least remember me.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.260
If you ever recall something

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.740
and feel like talking,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.220
please, be careful about it.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.420
Choose wisely.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.580
Make the right choice

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.900
and the truth will come out.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.660
But if you're wrong,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.060
you might never recover from it.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.020
Li,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.240
can you leave us alone?

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.860
Chief Wang,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.660
Director Zhou just went over the rules.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.860
Is it really okay

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.700
for me to leave now?

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.580
Not a formal interrogation.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.660
I just want to talk to Dr. Chen

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.660
as someone else, that's all.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.500
Go on, step outside.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.020
Alright, Chief Wang.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.300
About what happened,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.460
I'll be reporting it.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.900
That's fine.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.020
You can speak now.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.900
Where is he?
