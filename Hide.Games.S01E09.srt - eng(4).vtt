00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.080
Listen to this.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.880
Only the dead pose no threat.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.080
If you make the right choice,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.800
everything will come to light.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.520
Take some time

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.060
to think things over in this room.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.440
If you choose wrong,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.160
there's no turning back.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.880
I only care about the evidence.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.120
You think Wang Jian did this?

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.680
He's the only one strongly against you.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.200
We need to find out the truth now.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840
Everything I've done was to protect him.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.600
Sticking to the original plan

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.920
is the best way to keep him safe.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.720
He's fragile and very important now.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.880
No matter who it is,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
no one can get in the way.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.560
What if I don't agree?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.880
Whoever you are,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.960
I'm busy right now.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.320
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.600
Chief Wang.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.040
You can disagree.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.320
Let's see what you've got.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380
I've spent enough time talking here.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.220
I'm taking my daughter home.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.860
Alright then.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.160
By the rules, I can't stop you.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.800
But you were just kidnapped.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.280
I'm worried about your safety.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.520
So, I'll have someone protect you
around the clock.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.420
Please cooperate with us.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.120
Don't give them any chances.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.840
Doctor Chen,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.120
I need to be clear with you up front.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.240
I have two colleagues

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.520
getting disciplined
because you didn't cooperate.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.400
We're not like them.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.280
You won't get another chance.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.320
Please do your part as a citizen

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.840
and work with the police on this.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.280
As long as Han Xu shows up,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.300
we won't chase your matter further.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.880
Doctor Chen, I need a direct answer.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.720
Keep your voice down.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.520
My daughter is sleeping.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.740
Chief Han.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640
Take a look.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.620
Everything's under my control...

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.460
No.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.540
It's all under your control.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.120
That thing you mentioned.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.340
Is it really that mysterious?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.880
Of course. What do you want to do?

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.040
I'll give you a special deal.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.780
Don't hang up yet.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.420
Extract the sounds from inside.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.050
Doctor Chen,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.500
I need a direct answer.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.220
Come on, Nuo.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.420
Head in first.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.900
What do you mean?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.500
You want to come in?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.340
Special cases need special measures.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.280
We need to set up some things
at your place.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.300
We'll just work in the living room.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.220
We'll be respectful.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.340
If you were, you wouldn't come in.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.980
(Sound Synthesis)

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.100
Done.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.300
Say something to test it out.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.460
Hello.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.580
Hey.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.620
You...

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.020
You're good at this.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.280
Hold on, one more to go.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.620
And here's this one.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.220
Hello.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.180
Hey.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.780
How do I use this?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.780
I recorded both of their audio tracks.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.580
The left one talks nonstop.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.820
He's that super chatty officer.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.660
The right one's the driver.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.380
Thanks.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.220
No problem, that's what friends do.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.740
I'm almost there.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.100
How's it going on your end?

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.300
Don't worry.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.700
Stick to the plan.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.780
Got it.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.520
All teams, stay alert.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.640
Han Xu just showed up.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.540
He's heading to Doctor Chen's place.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.860
Naicai, Bagong, you're up.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.420
Chief Wang, any instructions?

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.820
Chief Wang, any instructions?

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.980
No response when we need it.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.200
It should've been replaced.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.180
The target is here. What to do?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.680
There's just the two of us.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.680
We'd better be careful.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.480
I'll wait for him outside.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.420
You stay inside.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.300
Can you handle it?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.340
Wait for my signal.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.740
Naicai, what's your status?

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.300
Naicai, did you catch him?

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.660
We got him. Open the door!

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.060
Doctor Chen.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.260
Please stay here.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.100
What's going on now?

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.180
Hurry up and open the door.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.260
You don't even recognize my voice?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.460
Doctor Chen.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.580
I'm sorry.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.890
I dragged you into this.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.680
How did you pull that off?

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.660
Just a simple trick.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.300
Why did you have to go out?

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.780
Wouldn't it be safer to stay inside?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.860
We've known each other for years,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.400
and you couldn't tell that wasn't me?

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.150
Why open the door?

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.920
I opened it because I recognized
your voice.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.380
Alright.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.780
So this is all my fault, huh?

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.020
What about you?

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.660
Telling everyone
you're a Muay Thai expert,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.020
and acting all high and mighty,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.150
but after a minute outside,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.820
you got knocked down and blamed me?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.460
How many moves did you last?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.460
I let my guard down.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.660
I wasn't ready for it.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.500
Alright, enough.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.580
So what do we do now?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.540
What else?

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.620
Just wait.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.760
Here, have some water.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.380
Doctor Chen,

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.980
can I really trust you?

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.580
Of course.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.780
Even if

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.060
I'm actually a drug dealer?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.500
Did something just come to you?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.220
Memories about Wang Mingcheng

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.380
just started to resurface.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.620
They tell me

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.340
he's my sworn father.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.940
Can you tell me

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.180
what that means?

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.420
You think you're

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.160
Wang Mingcheng's undercover
at the station?

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.140
I don't know.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.860
I get that all this sounds insane,

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.340
but these memories are real to me.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.740
I just can't deal with them at all.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.180
If I really was a drug dealer,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.420
how many innocent people

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.860
lost everything because of me?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.940
How many colleagues died because of me?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.980
I know this is all really tough,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.870
but you have to trust yourself.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.920
Xu, come with me.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.120
I've got a surprise for you.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.720
Xu,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.300
I've been saving this money in secret.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.940
It should be enough for us to get by.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.200
When are we getting out of here?

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.030
Xu!

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.000
I'm planning to deal with Xiao Ran.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.090
She might be working with the police.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.900
I have to go now.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.700
I'll be waiting for you here.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.860
This time,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.620
