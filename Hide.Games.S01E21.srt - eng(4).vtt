00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.360
I asked, and he admitted

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.600
that he killed Xiao Ran.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.320
I thank you on Xiao Ran's behalf.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.600
It likely wasn't his choice.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.000
I know.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.800
But I need to hear him say it.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.240
Let me go question him.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.440
I'll handle it.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.260
It's inconvenient for you.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.800
Only I

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840
have the right.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.680
Was killing Xiao Ran

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.000
your idea

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.280
or Wang Mingcheng's?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.680
You're one tough one,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.640
still breathing till now.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.920
Answer my question.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.160
It was my call.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.880
Your call?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.120
Why? Why?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.240
You disabled man.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.480
I just wanted to kill her.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.040
There was no reason.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.280
If I'd known then,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.560
I'd have killed you right there

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.640
the first time I saw you.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.560
What's your name?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.720
Han Yu.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
You little brat,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.600
full of nasty tricks.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280
You're kind of like me.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.120
Stick with me.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240
From now on, you're Wang Yu.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.000
Stop right there.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.320
Stop hitting him.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.000
What is he even worth?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.400
He's as weak as a chick.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.920
I don't care.
If you want to hit him, hit me, too.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.880
If it's not done by dark,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.960
you'll be fed to the dogs.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.560
Why?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.240
You're the weakest.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.960
Why would Xiao Ran choose you?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.840
I can't figure it out.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.600
She had it coming.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.040
I stole this from the kitchen for you.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.280
Thanks.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.840
This was my dad's keepsake.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.560
I'm giving it to you.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560
If anyone picks on you again,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.960
use this to protect yourself.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.440
Just because you were missing an arm,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
you thought

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.480
the whole world owed you.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760
Even Godfather spoiled you

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.720
and hired a master

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.480
to teach you about drug making.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.000
We fought for our lives out there.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.960
Among eleven brothers,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.360
I'm the only one left.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.200
You...

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.840
Why was it you?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.880
Why?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.840
You know what?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.800
I could've let her go,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.880
but I chose to end her life.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.280
You wanted to spare Xiao Ran?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.180
Do you even deserve that?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.420
I'm running out of patience.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.600
Was it Wang Mingcheng's order?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.240
He wanted to keep me here,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.800
so he chose to kill Xiao Ran?

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.320
Tell me. I want the truth now.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.200
Come on.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.450
Come on then.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.800
I want you to tell me.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.960
Tell me.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.440
Tell me now.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.520
Tell me.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.160
Tell me.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.800
Tell me.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.840
Yes.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.560
Yes.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.400
I wanted to save her.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.480
But I dared not defy Godfather.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.240
End this for me.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.780
Everything that happened

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.640
to Xiao Ran,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.440
you, and me

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.920
was because of Wang Mingcheng.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.320
When you hit the road,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.560
take it slow

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.880
and wait for him.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.880
Got it?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.600
Same as we thought.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.560
Then I'll find a way

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.960
to lure Wang Mingcheng out.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240
You let Han Xu go

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.880
and tricked Ma here.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.960
Going back means death.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360
Even if I die,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.600
I'd still take a bite out of him.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.680
You like Xiao Ran, too,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.120
right?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.000
I once wanted to kill you.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.760
But then I thought

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.960
it wouldn't be my turn anyhow.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.800
If you want to avenge her,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.560
do as I say.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.960
I have a plan.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.200
You two.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.400
Given your ties to Chief Ma,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.020
there's a need

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.420
to send you to the Inspection Unit

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.400
for a review.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.680
This time,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.560
I've reported on your behalf.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.640
Take them away.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.920
- Move.
- Let's go.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.200
Hello?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.240
Director Zhou has passed away.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.760
Songtai gave his life.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.600
We now think

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.400
Chief Ma is one of them.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.440
It depends on whether Han Xu
can recall anything.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.720
Why don't you come over?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.640
Let's discuss our next move.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.500
The lighthouse in your hometown

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.120
is where it all began.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.200
The lighthouse?

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.660
(Han Xu: 1st)

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.000
(Han Yu: 2nd)

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Han Yu, I came in first.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.360
You're in second place.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.600
Next time, I'll be first.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.740
(Han Xu: 1st)

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.960
Xu.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.640
Xu.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.520
Xu.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.200
Help me! Please help me!

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.600
Xu, save me! Please!

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:15.620
(M City Central Hospital,
B-ultrasound report)

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.840
Hello? Doctor Chen, I remember now.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.720
I know the whole truth.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.500
I have a younger brother.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.440
His name's Han Yu.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.840
He's out for revenge on me.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.480
He killed Xiao Ran, An Shaocong,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.440
and Wu.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.880
Everything was his doing.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.720
I have proof.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.560
Be careful; he might come after you.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.360
Hello?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.200
Han Xu.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.960
My dear brother.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.760
Ready for my second gift?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.340
