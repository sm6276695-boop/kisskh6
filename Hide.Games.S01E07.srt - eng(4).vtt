00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.980
Xu.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.340
Why are you here?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.580
Where is this place?

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.160
Come with me, I've got a surprise for you.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.780
Xu, you're back.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.700
What's going on?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.400
Why does everyone seem to know me?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.700
Guess you're just popular.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.180
Let's go.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.940
Don't be scared, just come with me.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.500
Let's go.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.190
Come on, let's move.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.100
It's alright.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.140
Xu, wait for me a sec.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.540
Xu, I saved this money in secret.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.120
It's enough for us to get by.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.860
When do we make our escape?

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.540
I don't know what's going on,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.660
but I feel like

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.820
we should leave now.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.820
Let's go.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.660
Xu.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.280
I know a shortcut we can use to get out.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.220
Follow me.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.220
Watch your step.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.780
Who's there?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.660
Don't move.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.380
Xu!

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.020
Wang Mingcheng?

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.760
You should call me dad.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.180
Calling me by name...

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.620
That's a bit rude, isn't it?

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.300
I knew it.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.220
That Xiao Ran you mentioned

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.620
is really no good.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.580
How about I find you someone else?

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.500
No.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.420
Don't hurt her.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.180
It's all my fault.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.460
Punish me.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.340
Just don't hurt her.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.810
Good son.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.220
How could I bear to punish you?

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.460
You're my lucky charm, after all.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.220
But

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.700
I'll let this slide, just once.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.500
Don't let it happen again.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.660
I need water.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.940
Get the water.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.300
It's been ages

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.100
since we used dialect.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.260
Thanks.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.220
How's it going?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.940
Did anything come to mind?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.580
Yeah.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.940
Any leads about 405?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.860
I'll let this slide, just once.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.180
Don't let it happen again.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.940
No.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.180
Nothing came back to me.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.260
My memory's just blank.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.840
It's almost all darkness.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.580
So, Dr. Chen,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.540
this method isn't working much.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.860
We don't have any better ideas right now.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.620
Well,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.700
you can rest a bit.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.740
Then we'll try again.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.580
It's chaos out there already.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.660
We need to find another time and chance.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.620
All the officers have been sent out

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.380
to searching for Han Xu.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.140
I'm worried

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.380
they'll find this place.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.580
I have a way

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.980
to buy us some time.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.520
What are you thinking?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.020
Everything you did today

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.580
will make them suspicious.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.260
They might not trust you.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.860
Hello, this is Chen Yasin.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.420
Han Xu has kidnapped me.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.340
I escaped when he wasn't looking.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.300
It seems like I'm in the village,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.500
North District.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.100
I don't know the exact spot.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.500
Please come get me.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.780
There's no time for another hypnosis.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.960
How about this,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.620
just contact me when you have time.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.380
Don't lose hope.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.210
As long as we're together,

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.140
we can help you get your memory back.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.020
Dr. Chen,

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.940
you don't need to.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100
I know what I'm doing.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.220
This Dr. Chen seems

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.940
interested in you.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.500
Stop making stuff up.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.260
Go look into it.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.900
Into what?

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.620
We don't have any leads right now.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.420
Check out anything related to 405.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.620
Maybe

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.630
you missed something.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.540
Alright.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.640
I'll take another look.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.820
And you,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.780
for now,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.340
just stay here.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.340
Lie low for a while.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.220
I'll contact you via this phone.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.420
I'll check in with updates every day.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.340
Remember this,

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.540
hide if you can.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.700
If anything feels off,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.820
run right away.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.980
That car outside

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.580
is for you to use.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.260
Be careful.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.020
There's no trace of semen DNA.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.060
You can't visit the scene.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.500
Your head

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.780
really did take a bad hit.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.020
Xu.

(Hell Is Never Empty)

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.340
Why don't you bow, guest?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.100
Master,

00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.620
I know

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.980
the rules here,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.780
but in your temple,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.380
you honor Rakshasa.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.660
So I can't bow.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.980
You're only seeing the surface.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.340
If your heart holds darkness,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.940
then you worship Rakshasa.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.060
If your heart holds light,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.940
then you worship Buddha.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.340
Master,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.540
between Buddha and Rakshasa,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.060
which one is true?

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.740
Which one is false?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.660
The Buddha is you,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.020
the Rakshasa is you;

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.380
thirst

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.660
and hunger

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.540
are you as well.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.660
(Wu)

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.380
If you're feeling restless,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.060
maybe take a walk outside.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.140
Master,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.860
I'm not sure if I'll ever find the truth.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.020
I believe you're truly fortunate.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.660
Just head out and see.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.220
Things will turn around soon.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.260
Thank you, Master.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.620
Why is it you?

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.540
Who sent you here?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.560
It's fine if you don't say.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.410

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.460
