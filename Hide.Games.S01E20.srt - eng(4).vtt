00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.240
I remember now.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.000
I feel like I owe you an apology.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.400
Sorry.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.480
You don't owe me anything.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.000
No guilt between us.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.800
So, did anything come back to you?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.480
Report.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.760
I want to challenge.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.200
Who do you want to challenge?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.280
I want to challenge you.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.160
Come on.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.120
I don't hit women.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.080
Go back.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.520
I won.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
Last minute.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.160
If you can't find the last suspect,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.520
everyone runs 10 km with full gear.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.800
Report.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.920
What are you doing?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.040
Time's up.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.040
The capture failed.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.440
I just remembered

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.200
our college days.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.990
- Chen Yasin.
- Here.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.400
Tell everyone

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.780
how you finished the mission.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.760
Sir,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.000
I...

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.000
I used charm on Han Xu.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.920
Of course, I wanted to win.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.640
I remember now. Really.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.320
But another me

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480
seems to have gone.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.760
Good.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.960
Good.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.080
What's your plan now?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920
He once told me

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600
that the lighthouse in my hometown

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.200
is where it all began.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.600
I'm planning to go see it.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.640
The lighthouse?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.400
Yeah.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.710
The insider cop

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.800
has been using this number
to reach Wang Mingcheng.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.760
(Insider cop)

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.600
I'll leave it to you.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.680
Sure, I'll wait for you.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.200
Sorry about that.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.520
Han is still the sharpest.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.160
We've been at this for so long,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.360
but we couldn't help.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.420
(Insider cop)
Yet he brought us the lead.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.680
This time,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.120
I got two real ones.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.640
If this number

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.920
is really what we think,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.440
then today

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520
is when we finish the job.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.800
When it's done,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.580
we'll celebrate your success.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.580
Do you really think it's him?

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.620
I think so.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.480
My luck

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.760
has always been good.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.960
Let's go.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.040
How could he have escaped?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.400
He didn't escape.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.440
We didn't even see him.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.560
Go question them first.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.120
I have to go.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.120
Alright.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.480
Director.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.560
Got you.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.410
Watch the evidence; I'll go after him.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.560
Don't move.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.600
Put your gun down.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.120
Director Zhou.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.840
Spare yourself some dignity.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.000
Songtai.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.200
Stay calm.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
What do you want?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.080
Women?

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.120
Money?

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.680
Name the amount, and I'll pay it.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.520
I only want you.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720
Drop the gun.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.140
Chief Ma.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.000
Songtai.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.040
Let Director Zhou go.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.240
Don't get in my way.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.700
I'm the Senior Inspector of Police HQ.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.600
I'm here under orders
to arrest the mole.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.540
- Why should I trust you?
- I don't need you to.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.600
If we take him back,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.240
you'll see the proof.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.040
Nice.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.040
Well done.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.080
All my efforts to mentor you paid off.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.120
Senior Inspector?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.320
This guy hid himself deep.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.160
Clean up the scene.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.700
(Tyrone Hotel)

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.000
Sworn Father.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040
Zhou's been exposed.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.870
What should I do next?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.440
Got it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.280
Good son.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.800
You did well.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.840
Come back.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.120
Chief Ma.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.110
Chief Ma.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.980
(Mysterious prison guard)

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.760
Jiu.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.760
Coming.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.960
Boss.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.560
Why is the door locked?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.700
I was tired from the journey yesterday,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.640
so I wanted to nap.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.840
What's up?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.400
Ma is back.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.760
Go pick him up.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.120
Only use this phone to reach him.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.880
I don't smoke.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.040
Boss Ma, you've been gone for years.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.920
We thought you were dead.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.000
Don't pry

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.760
into my business.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.680
Why is it prying?

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.280
I'm just concerned for you.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.200
Not many of the kids

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.900
from your group back then survived.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.520
Seeing you today

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.440
really makes me happy.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.400
Remember?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.440
Back then,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.280
who cooked for you guys?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.280
I didn't do much.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.920
Just helped my sworn father

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.400
handle some dirty work.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.080
You vanished for years

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.320
and went deep undercover?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:05.960
Impressive.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.200
I knew it.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.600
When the cops raided,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.080
the Boss not only escaped

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.880
but also killed the cop
and the informant.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.440
Do you know who that informant was?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.360
- Xiao Ran.
- I know.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.360
I'm the one who dealt with Xiao Ran.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.720
That's a huge deal.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.620

Where is this?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.360
Things are tense lately.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.840
The Boss changed the spot.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.310
Let's move.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.720
The Boss is waiting inside.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.320
Sworn Father?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.480
Wang Yu.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.240
Why is it you?
