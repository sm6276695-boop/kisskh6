00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.440
Master.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.960
I can go myself.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.040
You stay out of it.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.520
Did Wu tell you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.540
about the man who reported the case?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.800
He said it was me.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.280
It really was you?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.320
I don't remember.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.720
Don't worry.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.480
No matter who this case involves,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.760
I'll look into everything.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.240
My condolences.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.600
I never expected him

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.440
to be the first to go

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.320
among the three of us.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.680
You're Mr. An's friend?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.240
You've forgotten me?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.000
You do look familiar.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.280
Sorry about that.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.240
My memory's been bad lately.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.040
You weren't like this
when you chased me.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.680
I chased you?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.520
Yeah.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.440
So we were...

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.360
I dumped you later on.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.240
You, me, and Mr. An

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.440
were classmates at the police academy.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.760
After graduation, I left the field

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.480
and opened a psychological clinic.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.960
Come by sometime.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.700

(Hypnosis and heal)

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.680
Let me fix your mind.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Hey, Master.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.160
Where's Xiao Ran's body?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.280
I want to go see her.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.120
Chief Han.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.480
If it's confirmed, please sign.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.500
(Body Identification Form)

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.640
Where's the autopsy report?

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.920
I'm sorry.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.120
Chief Wang said you can't see it.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.040
If I can't see it, can you tell me?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.280
It's nothing serious.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.220
Just make an exception.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.600
Chief Han, don't let anyone know.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.400
Aside from the fatal wound
in Xiao Ran's body,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.360
they also found and extracted

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.120
a male DNA sample.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.320
Whose is it?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.680
Officer An Shaocong's.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.960
Are you sure?

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.700
Did you tell Wang Jian
about Xiao Ran and me?

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.580
No.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.940
But Master,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.020
I want to know

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.140
what really happened.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.500
Was it you?

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.900
I don't know.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.220
I don't remember.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.060
Wu,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.680
I need you to do me a favor.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.500
Help me

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.700
buy some more time.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.460
I'll give you

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.820
and Wang Jian an answer.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.620
Where are you going?

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.980
Didn't expect you'd show up so soon.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.420
I did my homework.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.860
You're the top psychiatrist in town.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.660
So,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.140
I need your help.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.740
As my ex-boyfriend

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.980
or patient?

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.060
Which is safer?

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.780
Let's go over this.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.260
You said Han Xu reenacted the killer's

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.060
every move and step.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.180
When he heard

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.460
about An Shaocong and Xiao Ran's affair,

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.860
he lost control.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.300
But you think he can't recall it all.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.580
Yes.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.620
My master, he...

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.660
Han Xu.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.620
He's in deep pain.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.140
I feel he's at his limit.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.300
Chief Wang.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.780
I believe he's a good man.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.820
A good man?

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.680
Come here.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.500
Take a look.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.380
Every single time,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.740
he's the one in charge
of catching Wang Mingcheng.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.940
All the dealers got caught.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.420
Why does Wang Mingcheng

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.780
get away every time?

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.620
Also,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.580
there are even stronger drugs now

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.780
hitting the streets.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.380
Their undercover died

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.820
right alongside Xiao Ran.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.860
And you're telling me he's a good guy?

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.460
Is that your personal opinion

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.900
or a professional police officer's?

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.220
I haven't changed my mind.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.020
But I'll follow orders.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.020
Alright.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.780
Stay out of everything else.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.860
Just focus on doing your job.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.020
Have some water first.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.300
You said you dreamed of killing someone.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.580
Then that person actually died.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.780
I used to think

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.700
I had no reason to kill him.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.300
But now, I'm doubting myself.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.220
It's like I'm just a bystander,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.060
watching myself do all those things.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.980
That's why I think...

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.820
You think you have

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.700
a split personality?

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:46.790
Right.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.740
You need to know

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.540
that dreams in our minds

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.780
don't last forever.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.930
After we wake up,

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.580
they change over time.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.340
You mean

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.100
I deliberately linked my dream

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.740
to a real case in life?

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.260
It's possible.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.420
Then what about my memories?

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.060
Why can't I remember so many people?

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.860
Maybe your head

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.340
once took a serious hit.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.940
But to be sure,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.140
I need to arrange in advance

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.460
a full checkup for you.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.340
I don't have time.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.860
Treat me right now.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.540
I already started.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.060
What do you mean?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.820
Wang Mingcheng is right inside.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.220
I'll go get the informant out.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.370
Master.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.880
Where's Wang Mingcheng?

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.460
He got away.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.140
Did you find the refined formula?

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.380
(Police)

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.710
Nuo, come here.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.700
Your daughter?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.220
Yeah, Nuo. She's eight now.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.620
Go on, go play.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.620
Where's your husband?

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.580
He's gone.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.340
No idea when he'll be back.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.220
So, do you remember anything?

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.020
I think

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.540
I was on some kind of mission.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.540
There were bits of broken glass.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.480
But it's all kind of blurry.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.820
From what I see,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.660
you don't have a split personality.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.980
What?

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.400
You're saying I'm fine?

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.900
I can tell you with confidence

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.620
that you definitely don't have that.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.120
Then what's going on with me?

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.420
I need to make arrangements soon

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.980
to get your head checked

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.120
and see if we can find
the cause of the memory loss.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.700
Sorry about this.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.300
We haven't met in years,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.940
and my first visit

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.420
is over something like this.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.980
I'm just glad you still thought of me.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.220
(Wu: They're coming for you. Run!)

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.820
Did you tell Wang Jian
about Xiao Ran and me?

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:10.980
No.
