00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.900
Place your bets, come on, hurry up.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.360
Nameless Rookie

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.110
versus the King of Killers.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600
You managed to find me.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.000
Not bad at all.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.480
Actually, I didn't find you.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.760
It was Zhang Ahua who found you.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.560
Zhang Ahua?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.840
Who's that?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.120
The young girl you killed.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.200
She's only twenty-one.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.840
I came here today

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240
to settle this debt for her.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.280
You shouldn't have come.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.640
Anywhere else, I'd let you go,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.360
but not here.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.880
This is the place under God's gaze.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.120
You could really die here.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.360
Our plan didn't just fail.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.000
It was totally out of control.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.210
It's my fault he got hurt.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.440
Don't talk like that.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.520
I came here hoping

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.840
we could come up with a plan.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.120
I don't have a plan.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.120
He doesn't trust me anymore.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.720
And if we do find him, then what?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.480
I honestly have no idea.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.320
I shouldn't have come up with this plan.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.880
Keep going.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.200
I just don't get it.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.120
You've got people backing you,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.440
shielding you.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.280
I was even told to steer clear of you.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.600
But look at you now,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.400
do you really deserve it?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
I was thinking

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.680
if we manage to find him,

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.760
we should just tell him the truth.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.600
No way.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.720
Absolutely not.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.120
He's been through so much.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.400
And his memory hasn't come back.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.990
Right now he's probably

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.560
in a highly unstable mental state.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.640
If he takes another hit,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.480
he could totally lose his grip.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.840
What does that mean?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.840
It means he'll lose his mind.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.760
And develop a protective personality.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.360
This another self has no reason.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.560
Its possessiveness and aggression run high.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.640
If it's not kept in check in time,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.720
this second personality

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.600
will slowly consume the host.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.480
Come on, again.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.120
I'll turn everyone who helps you,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.120
everyone who likes you,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.960
and everyone you like,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.080
into gifts just for you.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.410
The Buddha is you, the Rakshasa is you.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.680
Victory!

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.250
Nameless Rookie has won.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.940
(Train Station)

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.610
Still following me?

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.130
Until you get on.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.010
Until you leave on that train.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.610
- What?
- Songtai.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.570
Songtai!

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.690
Songtai!

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.770
Songtai!

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.850
What are you doing?

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.530
Everyone, make way.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.930
Move aside.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.890
Chief Wang,

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.010
I'll be straight with you.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.450
I came despite being hunted.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.930
People like us, pushed aside,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.330
should join forces,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.650
and find the truth together.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.850
What do you say?

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.290
Impressive for someone so young.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.050
But I got suspended.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.730
This matter...

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.530
I can't help much.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.090
I looked into you.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.010
I know.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.250
You're not some rigid fool.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.490
Oh, you checked on me?

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.330
I did some digging on you too.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.210
The junior officer on loan.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.370
Your resume is a bit too fictional.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.490
You're too suspicious

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.770
I just can't stand leaving

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.810
without the truth.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.410
Besides,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.890
I have an offer you can't turn down.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.050
Each backup phone I own

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.570
has its own unique contact number.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.090
I'm warning you,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.010
don't talk nonsense to Han Xu.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.770
Dr. Chen already said,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.810
if he gets agitated,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.010
he'll lose rationality.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.090
Relax.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.010
I don't want Chief Han hurt either.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:36.570
So,

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:37.890
I need you

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.730
and your team.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.530
Eat first.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.970
I'm skipping the meal.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.410
Might be poisoned.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.570
And you?

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.170
I don't trust either.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.850
I've been waiting for your call.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.130
Master.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.690
Chief Han.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.410
I'm not your enemy.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.850
But not my friend either.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.010
Let's meet up.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.130
I can help you.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.050
Alright.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.370
Same place as before.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.370
Eight tonight.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.210
I hope what I see this time

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.330
isn't a dead body.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.420
(Wu; could be fake)

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.250
I'll ask questions.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.290
Just answer me.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.810
Leave out anything extra.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.290
You're not the real Wu.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.410
Who are you?

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.730
I'm on loan,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.050
a police officer on the case.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.090
My name's Songtai.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.170
An Shaocong, Xiao Ran,

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.690
and the real Wu

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.610
died two months ago, right?

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.730
- Yes.
- What are you acting for?

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.930
The station's plan.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.690
Case reenactment.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.210
The goal was to trigger you

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.610
to help you recover memories.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.130
But now the plan

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.450
has failed.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.650
So you're saying,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.380
Xiao Ran and An Shaocong

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.240
weren't killed by me?

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.210
Then who actually did it?

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.530
I'm warning you.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.050
Don't talk nonsense to Han Xu.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.180
I have no idea.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.040
Let me ask you again.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.090
Is this tied to Wang Mingcheng?

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.120
I don't know either.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.110
If I didn't kill them,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.290
why are they after me?

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.290
Chief Ma

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.820
pinned the deaths of Zhang Ahua

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.980
and the guard on you.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.140
The plan hit a snag.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.900
Inside the station,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.020
someone's taking you down.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.340
What about Room 405?

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.900
I found nothing.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.140
But during the investigation,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.420
I came across something odd.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.580
What is it?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.220
Xiao Ran.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.580
She's not really your wife.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.210
Xu.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.380
When are we breaking out?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.620
I'm taking Ran with me.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.220
I know a way to get out.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.100
I'm ready to deal with Xiao Ran.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.700
Your wife Xiao Ran is gone too.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.340
Only the dead pose no threat.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.180
Xu!

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.060
I know

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.660
it's hard for you to digest,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.500
but it's the truth.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.580
You're still lying!
