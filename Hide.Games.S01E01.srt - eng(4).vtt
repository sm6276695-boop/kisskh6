00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.670
(In Huaguang City,)

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.730
(a new narcotic is found.)

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.630
(Wang Mingcheng)

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.390
(is the culprit.)

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.600
(Two months ago, Han Xu failed)

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.680
(to arrest Wang Mingcheng.)

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.070
(He was injured and vowed to bring)

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.380
(Wang Mingcheng to justice.)

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.820
(Huaguang City border,
Meilanna Federation)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.940
What are you doing here?

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.500
(Xiao Ran)

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.120
Sorry.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.270
The number you dialed...

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.580
(An Shaocong)

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.740
Sorry.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.700
The number you dialed
is unavailable now.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.400
Chief, we're sure he's inside.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360
Let's go.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.940
Do you know him? Is he inside?

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.910
Yeah, I know him.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.860
I'm just the doorman.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.720
I don't know anything.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.560
Take him away.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.100
(Drug Manufacturing Plant)

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.040
You two, with me.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.500
Everyone else, on guard.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.980
Who are you?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.440
Are you out of your mind?

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.680
Police.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.620
Do you know Wang Mingcheng?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.090
I've been looking for him.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.920
Police?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.040
So what?

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.320
Take him down for me.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.920
Talk.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.040
Sir.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.040
I honestly haven't seen
Wang Mingcheng in ages.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.540
You're lying to me, aren't you?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.360
I'm not lying. I swear on my life.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.200
I haven't seen him in a long time.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.040
Master.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.360
Master.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.840
Master.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.200
Master.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.080
Master.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.880
Who are you?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.520
Who?

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.480
Me?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.760
Your student, Wu.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.120
Two days apart, and you forgot me?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.400
Wu?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.380
Shaved off your beard, huh?

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.520
You look a lot younger.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.420
Let's get to business.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.120
Come back to the station with me.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.360
Director Zhou and Chief Wang
want to see you.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.100
What's going on?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.100
We'll talk in the car.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.120
Take him with us.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.320
Move.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.000
What happened?

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.120
I can't say.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.600
Let's just say
things aren't looking good.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.280
You should be prepared.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.120
Someone died?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.760
Yeah.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.640
Director Zhou.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.600
Chief Wang.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.760
Looking for me?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.520
Who are they?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.360
They're colleagues sent by higher-ups

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.960
to assist with the case.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.360
Oh.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.360
What kind of case is it?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.300
Seems like a big deal.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.380
A murder happened
in the city last night.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.480
The victim was your colleague,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.040
An Shaocong.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.600
When did it happen?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.720
The forensic report says

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.520
it happened
between 1 and 3 a.m. last night.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.360
Right in the middle of the storm.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.640
An Shaocong

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.920
was the one you sent

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.400
undercover near Wang Mingcheng.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.700
After Wang Mingcheng escaped,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120
his cover was blown.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.960
We suspect Wang Mingcheng
was retaliating.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.320
Director Zhou,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.040
I'd like to join the task force.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.360
- No way.
- Why not?

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.680
I used to be a detective, too.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.880
Your wife is gone.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.040
What did you say?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.750
Your wife, Xiao Ran,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.160
was also found dead at the scene.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.840
How could this happen?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Who did it?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.440
My wife's abroad.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.440
That's impossible.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.920
They must have made a mistake.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.600
I'm going there. I'll check myself.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.560
Han Xu.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.000
Han Xu, calm down and listen to me.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.920
I get how you feel.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.400
But you're in charge
of Wang Mingcheng's case,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.920
and you're also the victim's family.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.980
You can't go to the scene.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.900
You know that.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.440
My condolences.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.680
You can't stop me.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.680
- Han Xu.
- Let go.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.760
- Han Xu.
- Let go.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.040
- Han Xu.
- Let go.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.710
Don't move.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.120
Let him go.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.200
Have Wu go with you.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.640
You can watch.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.920
But stay within the rules.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.460
What are you doing here?

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.640
Master.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.040
I just saw the whole crime happen.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.920
Like I was right there in it.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.520
Don't say things like that.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.600
I know it's not scientific.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.120
But it really happened.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.880
Master.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.840
There's something I've held back.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.760
Could it be that Mr. An and Ran

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.120
hit you too hard?

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.560
Don't report

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.640
what happened today.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.560
Alright.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.720
The crime scene is so hidden.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.800
Who called it in?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.480
The caller might be the suspect.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.640
I can't say.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.200
Tell me.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.440
It was from a temporary number.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.040
He said

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.530
his name was Han Xu.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.560
You're saying I'm the one who called?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.000
But there's no proof

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.240
that you've been to the scene.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.480
- So...
- So what?

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.760
So everyone thinks I'm the killer?

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.600
I believe you.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.120
Someone's clearly setting you up.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.320
What about the voice?

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.720
Did you compare it yet?

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.960
The results aren't back yet.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.080
No wonder.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.760
Any other leads?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.400
We found a hidden camera at the scene.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.240
The footage is encrypted.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.280
We're still decoding it.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.920
You go back to the station.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.120
I need to go back home.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.320
Remember.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.280
Do not report

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.200
anything that happened today.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.560
Got it.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.240
Chief Wang.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.560
It's Wu.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.640
I've got something to report.
