Come on.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.600
Try our coffee.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.240
No way I'd drink CIU coffee.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.640
I added sugar for you.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.720
It's way too sweet.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.120
You still complain?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.270
- Hey.
- What?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.780
What are you waiting for?

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.400
Waiting for approval, the usual process.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.980
Don't you have any questions for me?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.980
All the evidence is here.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.220
What else do I need to ask?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.080
Alright.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.660
Let me ask you something.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.280
What is it?

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.440
Just a small question.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.360
But I want you to be honest.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.400
Okay.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.360
Go ahead.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.400
I'll tell you what I can.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.880
That car crash last time,
when you caught me,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.180
what happened to the driver?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.920
I knew you'd bring it up.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.960
Here, see for yourself.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.180
(Details: multiple bruises found)

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.480
Died in an accident?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.040
He was killed fast.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.680
Still worried about others?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.560
Maybe look out for yourself.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200
Don't try to fool me.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.120
He died

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.000
because of us.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.640
That's one thing.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.240
Alright.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.420
So what is it?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.760
Go on, tell me.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.560
Wang,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.920
since I moved to the Narcotics Unit,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200
we haven't worked together

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.420
for seven or eight years now.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.320
Why are you guys

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.560
in the CIU so divided?

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.000
You're desperate to catch me,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.600
while Wu is trying to help me run.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.600
Now, even more lives
are dragged into this.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.480
Tell me.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680
What kind of plan

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.720
are you working on?

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.810
Anything to do with me?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.320
If yes, just tell me straight up.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.680
There was never a plan.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.400
Didn't I tell you? It was an accident.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.720
I know you can see through this.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.740
This wasn't an accident.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.500
He hit you like that to take you out.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.000
Here's what I think.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.920
The person after you

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.540
must be inside the station.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.800
Am I right?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.720
Come on, Han.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.420
That's kind of basic.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.780
Trying to sow discord?

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.300
Listen.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.060
We're pretty united inside.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.060
Sure, if you say so.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.820
Keep lying to yourself, then.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.460
All these years,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.540
your lying skills haven't improved.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.740
Say whatever you want.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.500
The fact is

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.300
that you're facing murder charges.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.620
As for me,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.100
I caught you.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.220
Alright.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.660
Let me ask you one last thing.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.180
This time, you got me.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.620
Did Chen Yasin help you?

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.450
Chief Wang, it's ready.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.780
Transfer Han Xu

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.340
to the southern prison for trial now.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.340
Chief Wang.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.880
There's been a homicide in the south.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.660
Director Zhou asked you to check it out.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.060
I'll escort this suspect.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.060
Okay.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.900
- Go tell Director Zhou
- Chief Wang.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.860
I'll head over
once I've dropped him off.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.860
It won't take long.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.460
Chief Wang.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.860
I'll report it as it is.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.580
(South Transitional Prison)

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.100
(Police)

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.940
Is everything ready?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.120
Chief Wang, don't worry.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.160
We'll handle it specially.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.460
Procedures have been explained.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.340
Thanks for your help.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.340
Looks like I guessed right.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.080
Stay put for now.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.660
- Don't give me another chance.
- You

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.180
haven't answered my last question.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.400
Take your time and guess.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.180
There's plenty of time.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.140
Move.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.540
Hurry up.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.260
Jacket off.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.580
That too, off.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.900
Faster.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.820
Hey, newcomer.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.380
Don't you know the rules?

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.780
I'm talking to you.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.620
Are you deaf?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.060
If he won't come over,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.420
can't you just invite him?

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.900
Useless.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.140
Not bad.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.260
Listen.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.540
I've been in a bad mood lately.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.120
- Fine.
- Don't mess with me.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.500
Let's stay out of each other's way.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.060
- Sure.
- Got it?

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.500
What are you doing?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.180
Get down.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.540
Newcomer causing trouble?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.700
How dare you?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.540
Go to the Disciplinary Room.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.780
This time, you got me.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.980
Did Chen Yasin help you?

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.580
I know this is all really tough,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.100
but you have to trust yourself.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.140
Stay here.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.640
Don't stir things up again.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.300
From now on,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.220
you're the boss of Room 4.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.820
Take all this stuff away.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.980
Don't judge me by my looks.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:33.500
Listen.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.460
I've got connections here.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.500
If you ever need anything,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.500
just let me know.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.100
Cigarettes, wine,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.700
or a girl to keep you company...

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.080
All of that can be arranged.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.300
Let me know if you need anything.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.340
My buddies and I

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.520
are with you from now on.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.180
Can you help me get a phone?

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.500
A phone?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.540
Yeah.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.260
A phone's easier than a girl.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.780
You'll get it.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.220
(Calling Wu)

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.500
This is Han Xu.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.740
How do you prove it?

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.060
The clue is in 405.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.060
Where are you?

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.060
I found a clue in 405.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.220
What did you find?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.980
I can't talk about it now.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.300
How about we meet up?

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.300
Eight tonight at the usual place.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.140
Alright.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.540
I might need the phone for a bit longer.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.660
No need to say that.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.700
It's yours now.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.900
Use it however you want.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420
I need

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.620
one more favor.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.140
Go ahead.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.020
I need to leave.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.600
Make some noise for me.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.420
What?

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.380
Is it tricky?

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.660
Not really,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.500
but I...

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.620
Sir,

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.300
I also need

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.740
a favor from you.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.340
Go ahead.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.300
I'll get it done.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.020
Sir,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.220
from the first time I saw you,

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.660
I knew you were loyal.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.540
I'll hear the verdict in a few days.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.540
My sister's address is on this.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.540
I've saved money for her.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.700
I'm most worried about my sister.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.540
She's really naive.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.820
I'm afraid she'll get scammed.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.300
You keep the money.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.980
Please.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.020
Take care of my sister for me.
