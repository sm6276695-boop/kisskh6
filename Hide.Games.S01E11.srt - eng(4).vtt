00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.520
The scene was cleaned up well.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.080
There's not much evidence left.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.920
The victim is Zhang Ahua.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.160
She was shot in the head.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.880
Her computer files

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.520
are almost gone.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.680
The Tech Unit is on it.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.960
But I'm not too hopeful.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.480
Anything else?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.160
Witnesses told me a few things.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400
But I managed to withhold it.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.920
They said before the victim died,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.200
Han Xu had been here.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.290
Over there, hurry!

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.170
Move fast!

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.720
Stop right there!

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.040
Don't move, or I'll shoot.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.360
Stop right there.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.360
Don't move.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.200
Don't move.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.080
Don't move.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.280
Why did you kill him?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.560
Who are you?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.600
You don't need to know who I am.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200
Just remember one thing:

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.600
This is for your own good.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.040
Tell me now,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.040
or I'll kill you.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.760
Want a combat?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.680
Wait until you're healed.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640
Tell the mastermind

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.160
I'll find him.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.120
I'll pass your message along.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.500
(Stop)

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.500
(South Transitional Prison)

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.800
Leave.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.280
Why pretend to be sick?

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.120
Mr. Han.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.080
What happened to you?

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.160
Lock the door.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.400
Mr. Han.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.320
Who was clueless enough to do this?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.620
Also,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.360
there are so many major hospitals.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.160
Why come to my small clinic?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.520
I get it.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.200
I'll mind my own business.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.320
Don't tell anyone I was here.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.880
Understood.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.500
(Zhang Ahua)

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.680
I'm Zhang Ahua. Have some respect.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.320
I don't have time for your nonsense.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.520
I'm Zhang Ahua. Have some respect.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.180
I don't have time for your nonsense.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.460
(Unknown number)

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320
Chief Han.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.280
I like seeing you so flustered.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.120
Just tell me what you want.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.460
Stop beating around the bush.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.480
No need to rush.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.520
I have a gift for you.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.800
I'm not interested.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.520
You'll change your mind.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.520
Why not check the TV now?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.640
The timing should be perfect.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.720
Recently, a serious murder
has happened in the south.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.560
The victim's name was Zhang Ahua.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.720
The police are working hard...

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.560
Chief Han.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.120
What's going on?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.120
What do you need me for?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.540
(Zhang Ahua)
I'm most worried about my sister.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.680
You keep the money.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.360
Please.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.320
Take care of my sister for me.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.680
Can you do that?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.960
If I can get through this,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.720
I'll treat her like my own sister.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.880
Someone made me say that.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.600
You're the boss of Room 4.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.360
How does that sound to you?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.600
I'll kill you.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.560
But I won't do that to you.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.960
That would be too easy on you.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.000
I'll make everyone who helps you,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.280
everyone you care about,
and who cares about you,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.440
become my gift to you.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.840
I told you I'd find you.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.520
Your spirit is impressive,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.840
but now's not the time.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.400
You need to get ready.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.720
I'm giving you the second gift.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.200
This poor soul

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.560
was supposed
to meet you tonight at eight.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.000
But he can't wait any longer.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.640
Only you can save him now.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.800
You have just 30 minutes.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.390
Mr. Han.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.840
You really need some rest.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.740
You've defied deities.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.740
You should be punished.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.000
Hey.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.720
The hacker helping Han Xu is dead.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.000
Who did it?

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.270
We still don't know.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.640
But this is already the second death

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.800
because of our plan.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.120
Your instincts were right.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.080
And you made the right call.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.040
What if I don't agree?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.560
Our plan has changed now.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.440
We're no longer on our original path.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.060
Look at what happened yesterday.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.160
Han Xu and I got hit by a car.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.920
It was this driver.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.520
When I looked into him,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.560
he was already silenced.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.520
There are just too many risks now.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.100
We have to find out who's behind this.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200
Or things will get even messier.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.960
Then Han Xu will figure out our plan,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.000
and we'll lose everything.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.520
Are you sure you're not the problem?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.760
I can't promise you that.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.380
You have to take that risk.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.560
I'm picking up this call

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.260
and giving it one last shot.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.400
If it still doesn't work,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.260
I'll let you know to arrest him.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.240
Alright.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.760
Only when he's right under my nose

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.840
can he truly be safe.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.520
Whoever you are,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.400
I'm busy right now.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.920
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.720
Chief Wang, you can disagree.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.920
Let's see what you've got.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.080
The gift is on the boat.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.760
It's been half an hour.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.750
