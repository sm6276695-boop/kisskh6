00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.860
Officer Han.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.260
So you're letting me go?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.160
I just frightened you.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.860
No bullets in it.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.860
Don't you want to know who made me lie?

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.300
Who was it?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.780
I don't know.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.390
But I have a recording of him.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.010
I may find some clues in it.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.020
Let me hear.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.900
Zhang Ahua, got your evidence of crime?

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.900
If you don't want to get caught,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.660
then do exactly as I say.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.420
Officer Han Xu
will visit you this afternoon.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.820
He's going to ask you to verify a video.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700
I don't care how you do it,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.190
just make him believe the video

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.990
was recorded two months ago.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.700
Once you finish,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.620
all your evidence of crime will be erased.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.540
If you mess up, you'll be heading to jail.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.140
So this is the clue?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.460
No, that's not it.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.360
I'm just saying,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.500
I've made a software

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.860
to filter and match audio.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.220
If you have a sample,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.940
we can figure out who made this call.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.380
Think about it,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.260
whoever found me before you got here

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.860
must know your moves.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.260
Call him now.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.420
I'll run the analysis.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.760
Then we can narrow it down.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.300
Take me to whoever checked this.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.180
I'll ask them myself.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.060
(Start matching? Yes; No)

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.140
(Wang Jian)

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.980
Han Xu,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.260
didn't expect this.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.580
Wang, how's your injury?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.820
It's because of you. Any regrets?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.100
(Sound Synthesis; Close)

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.420
I don't know yet.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.540
Anyone else involved?

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.820
Yeah, there is.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.300
(Wu)

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.740
Master, are you alright?

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.380
Wu,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.420
how's Wang's injury?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.130
Nothing to worry about.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.740
(OK)
They can't do anything to me.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.700
Wu,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.980
I know a few things.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.740
I think we should meet.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.510
Master,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.340
you're at Zhang Ahua's place, right?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.260
So it really is you.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.820
I'll send you the address.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.460
See you soon.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.460
Master,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.980
you lied to me.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.900
I'm not your enemy.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.460
I'm not your enemy.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.580
You really lied to me.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.220
Did you have that hacker trick me?

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.920
Yes.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.960
Did Wang Jian really fake the autopsy report?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.910
- No.
- Why lie to me?

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.060
Listen to this first.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.540
Wu, I think I know

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.900
who's tipping off Wang Mingcheng.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.540
I'm heading out to find evidence.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.880
If anything happens to me,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.010
remember, the clue is in 405.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.740
These are my words.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.340
You gave this to me.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060
It's completely real.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.100
Our hometown dialect is complicated.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.060
It's hard to fake.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.340
I'm from your hometown,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.500
and was your junior at school.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540
Only we at the station know the dialect.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.500
What's inside 405?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.620
After you lost your memory,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.060
I checked everywhere
tied to 405 and you,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.260
but found nothing at all.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.500
Everything I did

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.500
was just for you
to get your memory back.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.420
Master.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.820
Let's find out the truth together

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.660
and expose the mole in the station.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.900
You think Wang Jian did it?

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.060
Yeah.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.820
It's just a guess, though.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.140
Because he's the only one who dislikes you.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.100
Think about it.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.340
He locked you up

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.280
to prevent you from remembering anything.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.180
What's he so afraid of?

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.580
Though,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.860
I think there's nothing between Mr. An

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.140
and Ran.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.220
But I can't prove that to you.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.900
So I had to fake the autopsy report.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.580
Just so you'd be more careful with him.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.940
Believe it or not,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.620
everything I've done

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.940
is to help you get your memory back.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.060
All the answers

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.180
are in your memory.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.420
Sorry.

Making a delivery.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.180
There's a box of drinks for you.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.140
Are you Chen Yasin?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.220
That's me.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.920
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.100

Hey,

I'm just heading home.

I'm not a suspect.

orders from above.

Feel free to look around.

I'll just browse myself.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.160
Yeah.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.860
Ma'am, I'd like to try these two on.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.180
Sure, go ahead.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.500

Are you coming in?

Dr. Chen.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.100
Dr. Chen?

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.820
Dr. Chen, you're always so clever.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.860
Always got a solution.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.420
Just to see you,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.700

Stop teasing me.

I'm broke, I can't pay you back.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.360
Besides,

every police officer in the city is after me.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.490
I had no other choice

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.930
and had to meet you like this.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.920
Don't pay me back.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.830
