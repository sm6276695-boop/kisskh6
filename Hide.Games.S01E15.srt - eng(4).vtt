00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.600
- Han Xu!
- You're lying!

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600
- It's hard.
- Liar!

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.550
But it's true.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.520
What I said is true.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.440
Han Xu, Han Xu, calm down!

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.880
Dr. Chen, perfect timing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.870
You're here too.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.720
Saves me the trip.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200
Liar, you're a liar too!

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.240
You get us wrong.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.960
Chief Wang.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.920
What a coincidence.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.880
Chief Wang.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.360
Still the sharp cop.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.120
I thought you'd really backed off.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.080
Didn't expect you

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.880
to use me as bait.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.920
If we hadn't shown up,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.770
you'd be gone by now.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.080
Wang Jian, I warned you,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.200
don't provoke Han Xu.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.140
Why didn't you listen?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.800
Dr. Chen.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.120
Sorry.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.600
I acted recklessly.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.280
So now,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.560
can we talk properly?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.470
Han Xu's already...

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480
This tastes great.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.680
Where's Han Xu?

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.680
In our hands now.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.760
What makes you think
you can work with us?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.480
Well,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.920
I've got some leverage.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.120
We took leave to help Wang.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.060
What if the bosses find out?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.340
What can they really do?

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660
Wang's been good to us; we owe him.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.340
I know that.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.660
Just feels weird

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.660
without a gun on me.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.220
You know,

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.260
life's a strange thing.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.500
Chief Han

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.180
was a real hero

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.140
two months ago.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.900
Now he's lying here,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.860
looking like he's losing it.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.660
Why are you bringing this up?

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.820
What's it to you?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.300
Let's just follow

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.180
Wang's advice.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.460
Got...

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.900
He's waking up.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.780
(Sucha, Senior Inspector of Police HQ)
Let's start over.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500
Senior Inspector

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.900
of the Police HQ.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.460
I'm Sucha.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.060
I knew you weren't ordinary.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.620
Inspection Unit, right?

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.460
No wonder when facing Director,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.500
you speak with confidence.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.140
Wang Mingcheng's trafficking gang

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.100
has expanded fast in recent years,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.940
and here

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.740
is his main area of operation.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.620
The Headquarters suspects,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.660
that inside your station,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.580
someone is shielding him.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.060
So...

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.660
They used your plan as cover

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.900
to send me in

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.460
for the truth.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.140
At the very beginning,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.540
you thought I was the mole.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.860
After all, you made the plan.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.740
But you pulled off-plan moves.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.300
So I suspected you.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.340
Can't blame me.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.500
But now,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.340
seeing how you treat Han Xu,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.180
I think you're innocent.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.620
You sure?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.780
Well, I'm betting too.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.980
Only a few know the full plan.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.580
Just four of us.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.620
Three are right here.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.220
And,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.700
we've got a lead now.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.820
But no solid proof yet.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.060
We need Han Xu to regain his memory fast.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.060
So you acted recklessly

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.020
just to push him?

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.060
Dr. Chen.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.820
I've already been punished today.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.820
I need to join you.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.900
Our goal

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.620
is the same.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.060
Go on, inject it.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.580
I can't give shots.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.300
You're not injecting yourself, relax.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.900
- Hurry.
- I can't.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.340
We only want the guy inside.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.260
You two, get out now.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.020
I promised a friend I'd protect him.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.220
Want to take him?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.940
Unless I'm dead.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.070
- Fine.
- Move.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.300
Naicai!

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.540
I'll fight you to the death!

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.220
No time, let's get to business.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.000
Young Master, it's time to head home.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.580
We've caught the person.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.300
Alright, don't worry.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.900
Stop provoking him.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.960
Watch what you say.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.220
I'm afraid we might be too late.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.500
Han Xu is missing.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.380
Dr. Chen, he is still alive.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.060
Call an ambulance, quick!

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.060
Wait a second.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.460
No hospital.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.940
If we go there,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.900
we'll expose both us and Han Xu.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.060
So we just watch them die?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.140
No.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.780
If it's done by insiders,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.700
then we'd be walking into a trap.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.940
In that case,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.060
call an ambulance, then the police.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.340
This looks like a pro's work.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.660
If it were someone inside the station,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.460
they wouldn't cause such a big scene.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.780
Something this huge happened.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.660
How would you explain it to him?

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.180
No need to explain to him.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.100
If he really is the mole,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.060
he'll reach out to Han Xu himself.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.380
What did you say?

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.100
After you found Han Xu,

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.980
he was taken by someone else again.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.340
Wang Jian.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.500
Wang Jian!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.980
I swear I could shoot you right now.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.020
Director,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.900
I'm willing to take the punishment.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.140
But right now, the priority

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.620
is finding Han Xu.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.000
I want

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.940
all the security videos
near the safe house.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.020
You've been suspended.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.700
You're suspended indefinitely!

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.580
Now get yourself home, fast.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.780
I'll report it

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.860
to the Police HQ Inspection Unit.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.620
Get ready to go to jail.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.220
Alright.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.820
Thank you, Director,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.380
for all the years of care.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.460
Boss Jiu.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.460
You sure get things done quickly.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.660
Thank you, Boss Jiu.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.500
Your intel was spot-on.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.830
Aside from taking out those two cops,

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.980
everything else

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.900
was no problem at all.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.860
The money will hit your account on time.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.100
I'll take him with me now.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.900
My good son,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.300
you're finally back.
