00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.520
Boss.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.820
It's cleaned up outside.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.560
Son, perfect timing.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.840
Here.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.760
See the elders off.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.630
Mingcheng, it's not that serious.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.860
Let's talk it over calmly.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.840
Yeah, remember?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.000
I helped

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.340
with your first deal back then.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you first?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.000
I trust you.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.680
I can feel it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We still have the bond.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.240
Besides,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.900
there are a lot of questions

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.720
that only I can answer.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.600
The guys already checked the place.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.720
This area has no cameras.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.360
(612+(822)6537318)
Only a night market,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.740
a supermarket, and a hotel nearby.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.340
Easy to hide people and cars.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.080
The rest are old, rundown homes.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.120
We can rule them out.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.840
What about Chief Ma's side?

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.610
What's going on?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.860
They got the SWAT team involved.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.880
They're sweeping, too.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.830
I'd say

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.980
give it half an hour at most.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.720
That'll keep us on schedule.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
Alright.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.840
Thanks for your work.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.220
We're running out of time.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.280
A supermarket,
a night market, and a hotel.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.160
We can only pick one.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.560
What do you think?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.640
Take a bet?

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.880
I'm not lucky with bets.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.280
Hotel.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.000
Hotel?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.720
You should remember 405.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.400
Only the hotel links to 405.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.320
If our guess is right

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.640
and Wang Mingcheng did it,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.000
then the 405-related hotel

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.480
is our best shot.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.400
If it's Wang Mingcheng,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.720
someone will surely

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.880
tip him off.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.560
We only have half an hour.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.140
Tipping him off is a good thing.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.560
I told you to kill them.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.000
Not just scare them off.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.560
Uncle Kun.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.520
Huadu's biggest distributor.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.440
Tila.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.280
He owns a factory in Shahe.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.400
The two of them,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.160
plus the late Uncle Tai,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.800
control 75%

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.800
of the supply chain in the market.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.560
And you?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.720
Your base got raided by the cops.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.800
So, you're in a tough spot now.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.400
If they're gone,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.440
who'll handle your distribution?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.080
Your goal isn't to kill them.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.860
It's to intimidate them.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.800
Right?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.320
Why do you know all this so well?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.440
Don't forget:

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.800
Two months ago,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.440
I was the Chief of the Narcotics Unit,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.600
and my mission

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.040
was to take you all down.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.320
I was going to make an example

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.740
to scare the rest of you,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.800
but keeping two of you works, too.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.360
Gentlemen.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.920
Did you hear that?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.080
My son decided to spare your lives.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.720
Let's go over the rules again.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.880
You talk it through.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.800
I'm worn out.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.800
Why are you two so late?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.640
Hurry.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.800
Sorry, I had a stomach issue.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.840
Hurry up.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.400
Young Master, your room's on the right.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.520
If you want to live,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.720
keep quiet.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.440
This time,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.080
you'd better be right.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.240
Don't worry. I have a feeling:

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.080
As long as Han Xu's life holds strong,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.040
we won't lose.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.520
Then let's settle it happily like this.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.900
The cops are almost here.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.280
I won't keep you two any longer.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.240
When you leave,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.200
don't forget
to take this gentleman with you.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.760
Got it.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.440
- Master.
- Han Xu.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.840
Why are you two together?

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.840
We're here to save you. Come with me.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.680
How?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.220
By giving me one more shot?

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.320
This is 405, right?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.390
Did you find anything?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.760
You don't deserve to know.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.600
Don't get in the way.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.880
I know you're confused right now.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.240
But this isn't the time to explain.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.160
Just come with me.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.480
Tell everyone:

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.240
Pack up and leave in ten minutes.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.320
Keep an eye on that guy.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.960
Sure.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.400
Why are you here?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.560
Didn't you say

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.500
I should treat this place like my home?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.660
Do I need to check in
to enter my own place?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.080
I'm disappointed.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.640
I'm actually curious to know

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160
what's written there.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.120
Young Master.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.500
That was a bit reckless of you.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.160
The Boss is not too pleased.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.360
Just go along with him later.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.720
We were supposed to go save him.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.800
But he ended up saving us.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.200
How do we explain this to Doctor Chen?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.820
Look on the bright side.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.000
At least he's still alive,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.340
and he still values our bond.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.800
This time,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600
we really let him down.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.280
And we came back empty-handed.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.480
Well, not entirely.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.680
Boss.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.040
Want to take a look?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.180
I'm not mad because you want to see it.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.880
I'm mad because you act sneakily.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.520
This was yours to begin with.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.400
Are you saying

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.040
this is me?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.360
Think about it carefully.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.600
Let me jog your memory.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240
Your name's not Han Xu.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.780
You take my family name.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.920
You're Wang Yu.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.640
When I first met you,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.880
I almost killed you.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.720
He's dying. He's useless.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.120
Boss, wait.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.360
The dead are still useful.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:28.640
We can cut him open

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.200
and put it right in.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.920
Little rascal.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.960
I'll finish you!

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.640
Little punk.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.400
Full of schemes.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.440
Just like me.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.600
Stick with me from now on.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.800
I'm Wang Mingcheng.
