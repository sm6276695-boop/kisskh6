00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.480
This one.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Sir,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.160
you didn't steal this, right?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.840
I don't know anything.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.000
It's fine.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.320
Chief Wang.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.140
I checked the street cameras.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.480
No sign of him.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.240
This is confiscated.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.360
- Take it back.
- Yes.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.240
He has great counter-surveillance skills.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880
Looks like we can't find him for now.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.600
We have to keep looking.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.600
Without him, how do we proceed the plan?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.960
The plan?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.040
Director, you're still hung up on it.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.240
Our plan has already fallen apart.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.720
We should be thinking about cleanup now.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.760
Wang.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.360
Keep your emotions in check.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.600
I've got my own reasons.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.760
How about this,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.640
let's call in everyone involved.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.440
We can talk it through.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.880
What do you think?

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.460
(Suspected; Prison Guard: dead; Ahua: dead)

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.560
If he bolted from Chen Yasin's place,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.520
it's a few hundred meters to the shop.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.800
Why wasn't I informed?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.760
Everyone,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.360
so I'm out of the plan now?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.240
Burning the bridge.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.480
Songtai.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.260
It's not the right way

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.120
to put it.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.920
Back then,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.560
we borrowed you from above

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200
to have you pretend to be the dead Wu.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.040
Now that your job is done.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.440
Of course,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440
I'll report to them for your credit.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.560
Now, go back to Headquarters.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.520
Director Zhou.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.400
Don't think I don't know

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.400
the plan has failed.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.960
That means the truth isn't out yet.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.280
You want me to leave now?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.240
Could it be

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.280
you've got some other agenda?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.200
Songtai!

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.440
Watch your tone!

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.440
Why did the plan fall apart?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.280
You should know the reason.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.880
Behind my back,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.680
how many off-plan moves did you pull?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.360
I know that too.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.640
I'm giving you a way out.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.280
Don't just linger.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.840
You're not my subordinate,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.600
but your rank's lower than mine.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.640
Follow the order!

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.520
Songtai.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.280
Alright.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.480
I'll follow the order.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.120
See Songtai off.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.160
What do you mean?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.750
It's not safe out there now.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.320
They'll escort you.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.840
Go.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.130
I'll walk myself.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.240
Your phone.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.320
Why should I?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.160
As Officer Wu,

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.380
anything tied to your work,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.040
including your phone, must be handed in.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.880
Tell Zhou,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.160
forget it.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.320
In his eyes,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.240
we're all tainted.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.080
Hand it over.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.320
He won't reach out to me.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.020
(Personal information)

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.200
Director Zhou,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.080
given the situation,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.080
I suggest issuing a wanted order.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.160
Citywide search for Han Xu.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.760
On what grounds?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.220
You really want to claim

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.240
Han Xu killed An Shaocong and Xiao Ran?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.040
The cause of their deaths

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.120
isn't exactly a secret.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.640
But about the death of Zhang Ahua

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.720
and of the prison guard,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.040
I believe Han Xu is a prime suspect.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.880
That's nonsense.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.040
As for Ahua's case,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.400
he had no time to commit the crime.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.920
If you issue a wanted order,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.920
it'll be a clear wrongful case.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.960
Mobilizing the public

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.880
at the city level

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.520
is the fastest way to find Han Xu.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.000
Director Zhou,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.240
it's a temporary fix.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.080
I don't agree.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.800
We're in a tough spot.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.720
Don't make the situation worse.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.560
If you hadn't

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.040
locked Han Xu up

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.680
without approval,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.200
we should've had more choices.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.920
This is my case, I'm in charge.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.400
I decide if we lock him up or not.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.240
Alright.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.720
Enough arguing.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.360
Sit down, please.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.320
You two,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.960
bickering like kids,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.180
digging up old grudges.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.080
What's the point?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.200
We need to fix the problem at hand.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.280
Ma,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.130
issue a wanted notice.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.980
- Yes.
- I reject it.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.520
Li's already told me about your issues.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.720
You've gone rogue more than once.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.800
That's a fact.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.840
Here's what we'll do.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.880
Take two days off.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.720
The rest of the case,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.920
let Ma handle this.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760
Sir.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.760
Follow the order.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.300
(Reward wanted notice)

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.660
(Personal information: Han Xu)

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.460
(Wang Jian)

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.020
(Xiao Ran)

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.060
(Zhang Aniu)

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.280
If she can get through it,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.360
I'll treat her like my own sister.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.380
(Zhang Ahua)

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.080
Master,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.320
you cleared my doubts the other day,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.940
and the fog in my mind

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.200
faded a little.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.760
Today I'm here

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.400
to ask for your help.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.120
You left with results,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.320
and came back with reason.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.080
Very good.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.640
Very good.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.130
- Zhang Aniu.
- Yes.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.600
Come with me.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.960
To where?

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.040
Don't ask.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.240
Get in.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.120
Master.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.960
Zhang Aniu.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.640
Boss?

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.880
Wh-what are you doing here?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.240
Wait,

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.200
you finally got out, why come back?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.720
Left stuff behind?

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.360
You…

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.080
You became a monk?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.160
Punch me once.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.120
Huh?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.440
What do you mean?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.160
Don't tell me,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.360
you spent the money I gave you.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.520
That was meant for my sister.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.320
I told you to punch me.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.040
Come on.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.520
What?

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.720
Why on earth would I hit you?

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.520
At least explain it to me.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.280
Zhang Ahua is gone.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.960
She died because of me.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.400
I've known her for ages.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.320
She's helped me so many times.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.320
But this time,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.760
she got dragged into my mess.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.400
Someone shot her.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.480
Look at me... Look at me!

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.200
You know,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.240
Zhang Ahua was my only family.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.240
Boss,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.080
I'm begging you.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.360
Get me out of here.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.720
Tell me.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.560
Who killed my sister?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.480
I'll take them out myself.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.400
I can't help you.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.360
But I can promise you,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.240
about her death,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.080
you'll get the truth from me.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.360
Boss,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.200
I only had one sister.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.720
Ahua…

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.480
Ahua…

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.480
I'll lay low for a few days.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.640
Are you crazy?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.720
Get the facts straight.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.280
You're not my boss.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.480
He posed as a prison guard to get in

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.840
and killed another guard in front of me.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.080
He had a rough, raspy voice.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.280
Got any leads?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.720
Never seen the guy.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.060
How good is he in a fight?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.280
Impressive.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.440
With guns and murder,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.840
he's an expert.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.760
So, going by what you said...

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.960
He could very well be a hitman.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.000
Every boss in the game's got someone

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.720
to handle the dirty work.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.320
But…

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.200
Something's off.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.480
A Hitman…

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.800
Why would he know you so well?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.840
Did you cross some big shot?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.360
Got yourself a serious grudge?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.680
What is it?

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.100
Got someone in your mind?

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.300
You seem to know me well.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.360
My good son.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.920
Why the rush to find me?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
I've got a few guesses.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.200
Come on, boss.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.040
Take me with you.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.000
How can you find them alone?

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.000
I used to be a cop.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.760
Finding someone

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.600
isn't hard at all.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.800
Back when Scar was around,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.440
we split the goods by weight.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.440
Now we only get this tiny amount.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.600
It's pointless.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.560
Exactly.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.120
Things are really rough now.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.600
Hey, big guy,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.720
you've got the wrong person.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.560
Do you know Scar?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.880
That was ages ago, man.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.760
If you want revenge, not on us.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.600
Yeah.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.480
I know far more than you think.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.900
Otherwise, how could I have prepared

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.960
such a thoughtful gift?

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.800
Is this voice familiar?

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.600
No idea, sir.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.560
Yeah, it's way too hard to tell.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.600
Think carefully.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:25.920
Ow! Bro, that hurts!

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.480
I know, I know!

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.480
I remember now!

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.680
One time back then,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.400
I saw Scar talking to a guy.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.000
That guy's voice was the same.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.840
I remember Scar called him...

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960
Paka.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.360
Yes, that's it!

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.400
He fights illegal boxing
at South Ring.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.400
I've placed bets for Scar a few times.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.880
He's Scar's God of Wealth.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.880
Wins every match.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.840
Anyone else not afraid of risk?

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.160
I'll count to three.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.120
Three.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.080
Two.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.680
One!

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.720
Bro, you'd better think this through.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.360
I told you I'd find you

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.640
and I'd end you.
