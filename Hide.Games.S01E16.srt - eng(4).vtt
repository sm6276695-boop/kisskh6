00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.880
My good son,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.000
you're finally back.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.480
Wang Mingcheng.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.320
Watch your mouth.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.480
Call me Dad.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.600
Are you crazy?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.680
I'm a cop and hunted you for 7 years,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.280
and you want me to call you Dad?

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.600
You see me as your son

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.780
just to take advantage.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.160
It's normal you can't figure it out now.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.640
I'll explain it to you in a bit.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.480
Why is he still tied up?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.880
Hurry, untie him.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.440
Boss,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.520
Young Master hasn't been stable lately.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.600
He might hurt you.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.760
Nonsense.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.920
Untie him now.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.240
He's right.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.760
I really am a killer.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.480
I killed your man

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.280
and I wouldn't mind

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.840
taking your life too.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.880
You understand?

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.200
You

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.600
are still just like before.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.880
Still so hot-headed.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.720
Come on, sit down.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.760
Here, take a seat.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.680
Come on.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.960
Sit down.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.520
You can go now.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.000
- Boss.
- It's fine, go.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.040
Since you can't recall,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.200
I'll tell you the whole truth.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.760
Tonight at 11:08 PM,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.120
these people got into two black sedans.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.090
We preliminarily conclude

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.560
the one they carried was Han Xu.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.440
After that, the two black sedans

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.360
drove from Fourth to Second Street.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.160
This white car was driven by Chief Wang.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.040
After Chief Wang passed them,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.080
the two black sedans

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.680
headed into 11th Street,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.320
and stopped outside
an abandoned factory.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.030
Up until now,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.400
the location of those cars

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.280
hasn't changed a bit.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.680
Looks like it was abandoned.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.560
But at exactly 11:47 PM,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.240
an SUV left 21st Street.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.560
That abandoned factory

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.120
happens to be right between

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.400
21st Street and 11th Street.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.280
So we have reason to believe

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.360
Han Xu was moved into another car.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.600
Where did that SUV end up?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.560
In the end,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.840
at 21st Street

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.440
and 17th Street's intersection.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.120
But the cameras after that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.560
were all broken.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.200
Send me all possible locations.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.600
I'll get a team on it now.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.520
Alright.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.160
Investigate?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.400
Why wasn't I informed?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.480
About this matter,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.800
Director Zhou already gave the order.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.690
This case has nothing to do with your unit.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.680
Nothing to do with me?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.960
One of my guys on the team

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.880
is dead.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.520
Another in the hospital, badly hurt.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.840
You tell me it's not my business?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.880
That's Director Zhou's order.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.500
If you've got a problem,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.760
go talk to Director Zhou.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.880
You're an outsider here.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.880
Don't let me catch you slipping up.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.160
Or I swear I'll...

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920
Say one more word,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.920
and I'll report you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.560
for breaking the law and obstruction.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.510
Stop staring.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.360
Send it to me now.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.720
Oh.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.000
No matter whose fault...

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.400
This is all my fault.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.960
I never should've sent you
to the police academy.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.480
I thought having you inside

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.800
the police station

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.680
would make things easier for me.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.040
Who knew you'd end up
losing your memory?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.600
Only remembering you're a cop,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.840
and forgetting I'm your father.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.840
Look at the mess I've made.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.560
I killed one of your guys.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.280
I just wanted him to look out for you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.920
But turns out he was way too stubborn.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.840
He cared more about boxing
than his life.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.520
Guess it's lucky you took him out.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.320
Otherwise, we wouldn't even meet now.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.360
Seems you know what the police've done to me

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.000
even better than I do.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.640
Tell me,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.990
who's your man inside the station?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.600
There's no one left now.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.680
I can't cut it.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.640
Can you?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.680
Other matters,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.960
let's skip for now.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.640
Get some rest first.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
When the time comes

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.240
and you remember me

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.640
as your father,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.200
we'll talk then.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.840
Why the rush to find me?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.080
I've done it all.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.800
Where is it? Give it to me.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.000
This,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.880
you got it for me.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
I really can't recall.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.240
It's alright.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.100
Speak.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.960
Boss,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.920
I've checked

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.280
the news you wanted.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.320
- Boss, look.
- Where?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.000
Right where the black sedans vanished.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.120
It's in this area.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.240
Are you sure?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.120
That useless Ma.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.040
How can he compare to our CIU?

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.070
Stop staring, send it to me.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.300
(Route Log)

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.480
I know the city's surveillance inside out.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.640
So relax.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.800
Our brothers

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.040
will check the place out

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.960
before them.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.440
This time,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.080
it's my fault for dragging you in.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.080
Naicai and Bagong

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.880
went through life and death with us.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.200
We're all holding back our anger.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.660
We want to avenge them.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.400
You should head back.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.360
Leave it to me.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.320
Alright.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.080
This guy…

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.400
Can we trust him?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.920
He keeps things tight, relax.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.160
Let's go.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.000
Young Master, you'll stay here tonight.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.080
Some friends from the circle
will drop by.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.920
Boss Cheng got you new clothes.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.000
Go change into them.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.960
Boss Cheng

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.280
wants you in too.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.160
I'll head out now.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.560
You two, keep an eye on him.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.560
Yes.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Listen to this first.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.400
Remember, the clue's in Room 405.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.980
(Chen Yasin)

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.640
Hey.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.880
How's it going?

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.560
We've locked down the main address.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.200
Songtai and I are on our way.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.560
Can you two handle it?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.560
I picked the safe house.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.080
I'll take charge of this.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.600
Naicai and Bagong both got into trouble.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.800
I don't want to drag in more brothers.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.920
What do you need me to do?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.880
Nothing for now.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.600
Just stay put.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.880
Wait till I bring Han Xu back.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.040
Promise me.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.320
Bring him back safe.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.100
I promise.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.060
Gotta go.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.900
Without you saying,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.980
I thought you two were a couple.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.340
Are all Inspection Unit folks this nosy?

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.540
I'm trying to lighten the mood.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.500
I can't wait any longer.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.100
Since you can't handle this,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.380
I'll deal with it myself.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.180
I have my own ways.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.780
You don't need to worry about that.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.220
This time,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500
I must get what's in his mind.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.460
Yes.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.460
He's not my son,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.020
but he doesn't remember either.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.940
Enough, stop wasting time.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.140
Your people can't take him anyway.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.460
Even if I leave, I'll take him with me.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.100
And also,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.980
mind your tone when you speak.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.460
Sorry, I'm late.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.510
Sorry.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.700
Why don't you eat?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.740
Not to your taste?

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.940
Mingcheng,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.580
don't give me that cheeky grin.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.600
We came here today

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.340
for something important to discuss.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.570
- What's that?
- Playing dumb, huh?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.940
Don't pretend with me.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.940
Two months ago,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.500
you got hold of a top batch.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.570
You told us

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.960
you could make plenty more.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.060
We believed you.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.940
Gave you fifty million.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.340
It's been two months.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.660
Where's the product?

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.420
And now you're wanted by the police.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.700
Been hiding till now.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.240
Thought you switched lines,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.100
quit the drug trade

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.740
and turned to scams.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.830
You three started long before me.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.620
You're all my seniors.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.500
Let me first apologize to you three.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.980
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.820
Some time ago,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.620
I did run into a bit of trouble.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.380
But things are fine.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.500
My son's back.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.820
With him here,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.420
we can roll out the new goods fast.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.100
And

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.160
as a way to make it up,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.260
I'll cut 10%.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.220
10%?

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.990
Take care of someone for you.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.820
Let me tell you,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.610
we came here today

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.420
to lay down new rules for you.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.180
What rules?

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.660
Let our people

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.740
move goods in your turf.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.740
Also,

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.740
you have to hand us the recipe.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.340
Then we're even.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.740
What if I say no?

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.220
If you say no,

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.140
your goods

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.660
won't sell a single piece.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.540
Keep them to make noodles yourself.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.060
Looks like

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.100
you already

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.860
set the rules for me.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.780
That's your only choice.
