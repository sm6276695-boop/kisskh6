00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.340
You sure found a great spot

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.520
to spy on the Police Station.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.960
You're wrong.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.640
I wasn't the one who found it.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.720
It was you.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.520
Me?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.080
(Two months ago)
Isn't this dump

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.000
about to be torn down?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.120
The order's out.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.380
It'll be gone by year-end.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280
By year-end?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.920
By then...

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.760
we can meet across the street,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.200
no more sneaking around

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.200
like little mice.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.160
The way you look,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.660
at most, just like Mickey Mouse.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.000
Anyway,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.160
keep it steady.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.360
The celebration is ready.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.760
Okay.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.800
Chief, quick update for you.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.560
Next Friday,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.980
Wang Mingcheng will ship a load.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.920
A big one.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.200
The source says he'll watch it.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.320
Should we move in?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.680
Can we trust him?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.840
Very trustworthy.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.960
He's currently

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.320
the only core insider

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.400
I could reach.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.640
Alright, let me think.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.960
Follow my lead.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.800
Got it.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.760
Master.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.900
Master.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.760
I remember now.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.280
I saw Mr. An here once.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.400
Really?

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.880
That's great news.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.640
Didn't expect Doctor Chen to be the lead.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.000
We're getting closer to the truth.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.320
If we want the truth,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.640
we need to get the original video file.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.480
No way.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.720
It's way too risky.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.080
The whole city is after you.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.240
I know.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.240
But I might have an idea.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.400
Master!

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400
The decrypted video.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.360
You can't get away!

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.900
(INTRUDER)

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.200
Open the door.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.520
Chief Han,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.680
whatever this is about,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.040
it's definitely not me.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.820
Haven't done this in ages.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.600
I need your help.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.480
Chief Han,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.160
what's going on?

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.280
You still need me?

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400
Chief Han,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.160
you're in deep now.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.920
Destroying evidence is risky.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
You'll have to pay more.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.680
Don't talk nonsense.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.240
How could that be me?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.360
No way.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480
It is you.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.320
You sure?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.160
Absolutely sure.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.600
Your face in the video

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.880
shows no signs of tampering.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.400
And no one has the skills

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.640
that can get past my eyes.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.600
Chief Han,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.280
verification costs money too.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.700
You don't want the USB?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.680
Hold on.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.320
There's something off in this clip.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.680
Impressive.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.320
Seriously, a real pro.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.040
The timecode's been altered

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.440
and the edit marks were hidden.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.920
Wow, that's some serious skill.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.480
If you hadn't come to me,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.160
you'd never spot the trick.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.080
When do you think this was shot?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.840
An Shaocong

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.360
was the undercover you placed
by Wang Mingcheng.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.660
According to the autopsy report,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.760
besides the fatal wound,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.680
a sample was also taken from the body,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.640
showing male DNA.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.400
It matched Officer An Shaocong.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.560
I saw the whole crime scene play out,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.360
like I was actually part of it.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.360
The report came from a temporary number.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.080
He said his name was Han Xu.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.800
You're a suspect now.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.200
But you still have a choice.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.640
(No foreign DNA.)
The original report

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.560
shows no trace of semen DNA.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.760
Mr. An and Ran are likely innocent.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960
You, me, and Mr. An

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.680
were classmates at the police academy.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.240
This whole thing was against you.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.160
You know you're not allowed at the scene.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.280
Have Wu go with you.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.160
You can watch,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.600
but don't break the rules.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600
If he could make it stick

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.440
that you killed Ran and Mr. An,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.840
you'd be silenced forever.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.800
No matter who's involved in this case,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.840
I'll get to the bottom of it.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.400
You're a perfect scapegoat.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.640
My condolences.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.480
So far, no signs of split personality.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.960
About that brain scan,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.800
I want to do it now.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.720
Hold on, I'll set it up.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.920
Thanks.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.700
I know you've been in trouble,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.560
so I kept it a secret. Don't worry.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.920
Thanks.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.360
So what's my situation now?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.560
Your head indeed suffered serious trauma.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.680
How long ago was this video taken?

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.040
Two months ago.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.440
When exactly?

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560
Two months back.
