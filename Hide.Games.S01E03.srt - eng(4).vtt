Chief Ma.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.480
The target's inside.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.640
The rest, with me.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
Move out.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.640
Yes.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.720
You three, wait for the lift.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.680
I'll go that way.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.600
You two, with me.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.660
- Okay.
- You stay.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.020
(Wu: I'll wait in the garage.)

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.640
Mom, you don't seem in a good mood today.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.840
I'm fine.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.960
Remember our deal, okay?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.190
Mm-hmm.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.640
You two, head that way.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.600
You two, over there.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.510
- Go.
- Follow me.

(Pusat Perniagaan Golden Summit)

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.280
Hey.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.780
What's wrong with you?

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.760
Why'd you take my hat?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.080
Sorry, I mistook you.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.160
Psycho!

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.690
See?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.560
Told you to trust me.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.400
Yeah.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.520
Don't move.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.400
Hands on your head.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.510
Turn around.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.840
Found in the garage...

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.040
What's going on?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.960
Chief Ma, it's me.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.720
All clear on my side.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.600
Just a quick update.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.870
Sorry in advance, man.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.520
Get in the car, Master.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.360
Why are they after me?

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.800
The crime scene video is decrypted.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.790
Director Zhou, Chief Wang.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.660
This is from the night it happened,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.100
all captured by the encrypted camera.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.740
Isn't that Han Xu?

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.780
What now?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.700
Your case.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.340
You call the shots.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.340
Is your squad ready?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.260
Yes, sir.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.980
We can move anytime.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.940
I won't let anything slip.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.500
Go arrest him.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.860
Yes.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.500
No way, this isn't who Master is.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.340
Master,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.180
you're a suspect now.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.260
What do you think?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.580
I've been with you for so long.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.180
I know exactly what you're like.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.660
Let's take a huge step back first.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.620
Even if Mr. An
and your wife were involved,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.140
you wouldn't kill them.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.980
Trusting your gut is a detective's trap.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.940
I know.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.860
I remember everything

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.780
you taught me.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.420
Found anything yet?

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.060
I have two questions.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.580
Be straight with me.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.700
First,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.660
is it really true

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.460
that you remember nothing?

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.380
The doctor said
I might've had head trauma.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.620
So I've lost my memory.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.680
On the bright side,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.220
I don't have split personality.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.580
It's actual memory loss.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.970
Second,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.540
if Ran and Mr. An

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.620
were really killed by you,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.100
what's your plan?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.620
According to the autopsy report,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.720
besides the fatal wound,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.340
there was also a male DNA sample.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.500
I'm still a police officer.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.980
If you hadn't tipped me off,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.800
I'd have let them take me.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.500
You still have a choice.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.550
The Forensic Doctor

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.980
give you the autopsy report,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.180
but I had my doubts.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.060
She seemed like she meant well.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.940
But that was against procedure.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.580
So I decided to look into it.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.100
I was trying to find the original report.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.060
Didn't expect to uncover a secret.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.860
I said everything exactly as you asked.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.180
Did you get rid of the original?

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.180
Han Xu is a good police officer.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.780
Don't leave anything behind.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.420
Don't worry.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.900
It's been shredded.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.660
(No foreign DNA was found in the body.)

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.380
How could this be? Why?

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.500
- Master.
- You knew too?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.700
This is the original report.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.460
It shows no trace of semen DNA.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.180
Mr. An and Ran are likely innocent.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.820
This whole thing

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.440
was a scheme aimed at you.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.460
Chief Wang told me,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.380
I can't let you see it.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.140
You know you're not allowed at the scene.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.780
Think about

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.260
you and Mr. An's operation.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.780
You set up a tight plan

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.940
to capture Wang Mingcheng.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.650
Then why did he

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.580
still escape from your network?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.500
Could it be...

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.780
we have a problem inside?

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.380
Every time we went after him,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:36.940
he was the one in charge.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.020
You mean

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.060
they're trying to make it

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.100
look like it's all on me?

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.780
Master,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.340
you're a perfect scapegoat.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.100
That's true.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.860
Mr. An's my only contact.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.940
I've dealt with
Wang Mingcheng the longest.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.460
No wonder Chen Yaxin...

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.460
When Doctor Chen was treating me,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.700
I kept thinking about that mission.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.120
Wang Mingcheng was inside.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.180
I'll get the informant out.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.860
Turns out,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.700
that was where it all began.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.500
My guess is,

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.820
during his operation,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.420
you found something linked to Wang Jian

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.660
and he felt threatened by it.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.020
That's why

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.620
he used this chance to frame you.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.560
If he could make it stick

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.340
that you killed Ran and Mr. An,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.540
you'd be silenced forever.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.380
So,

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.900
you can't get caught.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.020
But why Wang?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.380
He's with the CIU.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.100
How could he know

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.440
a Narcotics Unit mission?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.060
Besides,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.660
he could never know

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.890
Mr. An was an undercover.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.780
That's exactly why

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.380
he is the safest.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.380
Think about it.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.060
Our entire station

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.700
only has this many people.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.620
You're closest to Mr. An.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.780
Everyone knows that.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.420
Mr. An suddenly quit.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.660
With Wang Jian's instincts,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.380
it's not hard to guess

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.300
Mr. An might be on some secret mission.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.140
If you follow that logic,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.860
you'd be a suspect too.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.540
Master,

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.780
if I were the mole,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.670
we wouldn't be here talking.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.100
In the whole station,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.620
I've known Wang the longest,

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.060
and we're the closest.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.100
It couldn't be him.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.380
Sometimes,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.340
those you know best

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.300
