00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.810
Don't spin stories in front of me.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.720
Back then,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.880
you were in terrible shape.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.000
My buddies

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.840
all told me

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.160
to get rid of you.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.360
But I couldn't do that.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.220
Rakshasa blessed us.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.540
You were a sharp little thing,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.260
so I had someone

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.640
teach you to make drugs.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.140
It took just two years.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.060
No one's better

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.840
than you when it comes to drug making.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.380
Stop talking nonsense.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.040
I'm Han Xu from Shafeng.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.780
I studied here
in middle and high school.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.520
After I graduated
from the police academy,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.300
I joined
the South District Police Station.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.060
Seven years later,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.460
I was moved to the Narcotics Unit.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.940
My mission was to catch you,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.740
Wang Mingcheng.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.140
It's all fake.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.980
I made it all up.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.540
And you believed it?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.980
If you don't believe me,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.860
go see for yourself

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.140
and find out where your home is,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.540
Shafeng or this place.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.180
Where were we?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.900
Later,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.940
you came up with the refined formula.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.620
I thought we'd finally hit it big.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.460
But that's when things fell apart.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.220
You fell for a girl named Xiao Ran.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.850
Xu.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.140
Do you really like her?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.440
And you want to marry her?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.860
So, you killed Xiao Ran.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.060
Jiu.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.980
Xiao Ran was a police informant.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.700
I did plan to kill her.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.380
But you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.700
were hopelessly in love

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.200
and insisted on protecting her.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.280
And what happened next?

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.620
She left,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.430
and our base got wiped out.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.460
Forget it.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.540
Let's not dwell on the past.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.460
I never blamed you for any of it.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.080
This is to welcome you home.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.980
Try it. I made it.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.600
What if I don't want to?

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.660
If my patience runs out,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.500
the bond between us

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.660
will be over.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.780
Boss.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.100
Please, calm down.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.980
Young Master.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.140
Give it a try.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.020
The Boss made this for you.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.320
How is it, Young Master?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.940
Good stuff.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.500
That's more like it.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.900
If anything comes to mind,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.860
tell me right away.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.500
Take the Young Master to rest.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.540
Yes.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.420
Is this a good time?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.460
Get me a glass of water.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.900
Quick.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.360
Your water, Young Master.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.220
Is this even drinkable?

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640
Tastes like horse urine.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.580
You looking down on me?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.600
This is all we've got.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.200
- Call Boss Jiu over now.
- Please...

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.420
You stirred up such a mess.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.540
How will you explain with no results?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.020
I'll leave you a body.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.940
At least the trip won't be wasted.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.940
I know exactly what you mean.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.740
You just want that refined formula early

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.380
so you can squeeze me for cash,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.620
right?

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.060
Listen.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.900
I have him,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.060
and I've drugged him.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.180
What could be more thrilling
than my drug?

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.580
Do I have to do
whatever Doctor Chen says?

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.120
If he breaks down,
I'll just keep dosing until he dies.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.760
Let's part ways.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.020
Listen.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.900
I'm done waiting.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.580
You needed me, Young Master?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.620
What do you need?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.120
Tell them to get lost.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.060
Out.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.940
Who are you?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.240
Why are you helping me?

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.140
Chief Han.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.600
If you know I'm helping you,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.420
don't mess things up.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.060
I've saved this glucose powder for ages.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.100
Next time, you might not be so lucky.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.300
Why did you betray Wang Mingcheng?

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.860
Because you gave me a code name.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.460
405.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.780
405?

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:01.780
You're my informant?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.700
No.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.340
You're not qualified

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.660
to make me your informant.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.420
To be clear,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.060
we made

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.180
a deal

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.600
before you lost your memory.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.980
With this look,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.420
it's hard not to stand out.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.320
What do you need to know?

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.660
Inside the station,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.500
who's related to Wang Mingcheng?

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.780
Are you trying to get me caught?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.980
Do you still want a way out?

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.980
You're really unreliable.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.620
When I found a lead and went to you,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.660
you were in a coma again.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.060
Later, I went to the Wu guy,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.700
and he ended up dead.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.860
Did you find the mole?

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.180
Who is it?

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.100
I found out.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.860
But why should I tell you?

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.180
Because you swapped

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.940
the drug I was gonna take

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.340
with glucose powder.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.020
You don't trust any of the cops

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.020
in the police station,

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.020
except me.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.340
Also,

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.310
I'm guessing

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.420
the lead you got

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.620
is also unclear.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.980
So,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.260
leave it to me.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.660
Don't worry.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.660
I can help you.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.500
I'll trust you one more time.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.140
Wang Mingcheng
always called this number.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.060
(Insider cop)

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300
Aren't you afraid

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.780
I'll admit I'm Wang Yu?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.700
Do you know why I wanted out?

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.540
Wang Mingcheng is too arrogant.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.380
He makes up lies no one would buy.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.940
It's just photoshopping.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.820
But you're pretty odd, too.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.420
You actually think
Xiao Ran was your wife?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.180
Did the amnesia drive you crazy?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.000
You don't even deserve her.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.740
Xiao Ran

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.260
was not your wife.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.460
What do you mean?

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.500
Spell it out.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.540
Boss Jiu, the Boss wants you.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.420
That's it.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.980
Make do with this place.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.780
We set up this room for you.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.900
We'll have a meeting tomorrow morning.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.940
Breakfast starts half an hour later.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.860
Please bear with it.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.580
We set up this room for you.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.740
Please bear with it.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.540
Xu, you're back.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.860
Xu, I know a way we can get out.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:37.860
Come with me.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.140
Where on earth did he go?

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.560
We've been searching all day.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.860
Boss Jiu.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.140
No luck; let's head back.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.280
You're asking for trouble.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.740
The Boss shot the guys
watching the Young Master.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.780
Eat up and keep looking.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.540
Boss Jiu, where are you headed?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.020
To the restroom.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.160
Boss Jiu, I'll join you.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.840
What, trying to outmatch me?

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.260
Hold it in.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.340
Go grab some drinks.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.140
(Convenience Store)

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.340
As you suggested,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.300
I gave Han Xu the phone number.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.740
What did he say?

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.780
The amnesia must've driven him mad.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.660
He even thought Xiao Ran was his wife.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.500
Find a chance to get out fast.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.460
Wang Mingcheng isn't a fool.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.660
It's not the right time yet.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.940
I'm just starting to figure out
the real cause of Xiao Ran's death.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.660
Who is it?

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.700
I'm not sure,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.140
but there's one person
whose role is unclear.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.780
Give me a little more time.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.100
Only when things are clear

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.440
can you get your revenge.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.120
If something happens to you,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.720
I'll offer an incense stick for you

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.540
on behalf of Xiao Ran.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.340
(Memory recovery: 40%)

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.580
(405 showed up;
the mole has been identified)
